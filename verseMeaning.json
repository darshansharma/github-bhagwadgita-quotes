In Vedic scriptures six aggressors may be rightfully  slain  at\nanytime. One who administers poison, one who commits arson, one who  attacks\nwith deadly weapons, one who steals wealth, one who usurps property and  one\nwho kidnaps a wife. The sons of Dhritarastra have  committed  these  heinous\nacts of  aggression  against  the  Pandavas.  The  word  atatayinah  meaning\naggressors can also be applied as criminals and  such  criminals  committing\nany of the  six  aggressions  can  be  rightfully  slain.  So  the  sons  of\nDhritarastra  should be slain without any hesitation or compunction; but  in\nrebuttal Arjuna is saying that sin would be accrued and hell  would  be  the\npunishment as a result of slaying one's relatives.  Their is  no  reward  in\nthis world or the next for such an action; therefore it  would  be  improper\nto execute this.  The  word  hi  means  certainly  and  this  augments  this\nassertion. By addressing Lord Krishna with the vocative Madhava meaning  the\nhusband of the goddess of fortune indicates that as the husband  He  is  the\nprogenitor of the family not the destroyer of the  family  and  that  Arjuna\nshould also not act contrarily to this.\n\nby Kesava Kasmiri.\n\n\nBhagavad-Gita\n",

Bhishma seeing all this gave a roar like a lion and blew a  mighty,\nreverberating blast on his conchshell which  was  followed  by  a  tumultous\nbeating of drums, blaring  of  horns  and  blasting  of  conchshells  as  if\nindicative of the victory in order  to  cheer  up  Duryodhana.  Immeadiately\nupon hearing this Lord Krishna and Arjuna seated in their  majestic  chariot\ncapable of conquering all the worlds;  both  seized  their  conchshells  and\nreverberated  a  sound  that  shook  all  the  worlds.   Thereafter   Bhima,\nYudhisthira, Nakula and Sahadeva and the rest  of  the  maha-rathas  of  the\nPandava army blew their conchshells and the roar  which  was  heard  cleaved\nthe hearts of Duryodhana and the army of the Kauravas and  in  their  hearts\nthey felt that the battle was already lost.

Such  a  transition  can  be  compared  to\ndiscarding old, used, worn out clothes and attiring oneself  in  fresh,  new\nraiment. So from another angle of vision it  is  being  confirmed  that  the\neternal soul is indestructible changing its embodied form for  another  when\nthe physical body  perishes.

Whom can anyone destroy? How can  anyone\ndestroy anyone? Who can cause anyone to be destroyed? No one  can!

So it can be understood that those who  have\ndeep regret for the loss of the physical body, serving as  it  does  as  the\nfacility  for  securing  and  enjoying  material  pleasures;  these   living\nentities should reflect on the futility  and  temporal  nature  of  material\nexistence rather than trying to eternally exploit their  senses.

It  is  because  they  could  not\ncomprehend the essence of the Vedic scriptures and subsequently they  missed\nunderstanding the true purport of the Vedas. This  Lord  Krishna  emphasises\nwith the word avipascitah meaning the ignorant  who  are  not  knowledgeable\nare attracted to flowery descriptions in  the  Vedas  even  as  a  beautiful\nflowery creeper may be  attractive  although  it  is  poisonous.  But  these\nliving entities are  ignorant and not actual  scholars  of  Vedanta  because\nthey are only devoted to those parts of the Vedas  which  help  them  secure\nmaterial opulence in this  life  and  the  next.  Such  statements  like  by\nperforming some ritual one can obtain  imperishable  merit  or  by  drinking\nSoma nectar one can become immortal, etc. Their conception  of  devotion  is\nbeing devoted to pursuing heavenly delights and they  even  foolishly  argue\nthat there is nothing more beyond  the  rewards  of  heavenly  pleasures  to\nattain. Why is this so for them? It is because their minds are  obsessed  by\ndesires due to addiction to material pleasures experienced by  contact  with\nthe senses of taste, touch, seeing, hearing and smelling. So they look  upon\nheaven although heaven is still in  the  material  existence  as  being  the\nsupreme goal. This is  because  in  heaven  there  is  neither  old  age  or\nsickness, everything is beautiful and a wonder to behold  and  the  facility\nto enjoy fully is increased a thousand fold.  So  all  their  activities  in\nthis life are enacted solely for the sake of accuring benefits in  order  to\nreside in the heavenly  spheres  where  they  can  enjoy  and  enjoy  for  a\nseemingly unlimited time span.  But  when  their  merit  has  expired  after\nenjoying the delights of heaven in various wonderful ways  to  their  hearts\ncontent they will again take birth on earth in a  rich  and  learned  family\nwho also are following the flowery phrases of the Vedas and they will  again\nfollow this path and at lifes end transmigrate to the heavenly planets  once\nagain to enact the process. By being born into situations  of  opulence  and\nprosperity  allows  one  ample  means   and   facility   to   perform   very\nextravagantly  the  various  prescribed  rituals  such   as   astrologically\nperforming activities on the auspicious days each month such as  purnima  to\nobtain the maximum result. Thus again and again from body to body  they  are\ncontinuously revolving like a waterwheel. In special situations  Indra,  the\nruler of the demi-gods  sometimes  appoints  one  of  them  as  a  gandharva\ncelestial musician or as an aspara celestial damsel among the  demigods  for\nthe duration of time their merit warrants.\n\n",

The root  word  hanti  meaning  to  slay  connotes  an  act  which\nconnects with the soul; but the action of killing indicates that there is  a\nseparation of the soul  from  the  body.  Thus  the  Vedic  injunctions:  na\nhimsyad bhutani  meaning  no  creature  shall  be  harmed  and  brahmano  na\nhantavyah that no brahmana shall  ever  be  killed  specifically  emphasises\nthat it is an  act  of  acute  and  heinous  unrighteousness  to  cause  the\nseparation of any soul from its embodied state unnaturally which happens  at\nthe time of death.\n\n",

But free from these impediments the  same  action\nperformed as worship to the Supreme Lord  becomes  the  veritable  means  to\nsecure liberation. Therefore be devoid of motive for actions nor  desire  to\nreap the reward from actions. Though all living entities  are  acting  their\npart in this  world,  those  who  are  situated  in  goodness  aspiring  for\nliberation are considered not to be entangled as so.

Similarly rebirth is unavoidable  once  one's  physical  body  has\ndied. How can something which has been lost become again? It is  conceivable\nthat   something  which  has  already  been  to  become  again;  but  it  is\ninconceivable for that which has never been to become.  Therefore  there  is\nnothing that can come that has not been. What is known as  birth  and  death\nis but just different modifications of an ever existing condition. Yarn  and\nother materials exist but when they are  woven  into  a  fabric  that  is  a\nparticular arrangement of the yarn itself, it receives  the  name  cloth  in\nits modified state. Even the asat-karya-vadis  who  follow   the  fallacious\nhypothesis that existence comes from non-existence  should  admit  the  ever\nexisting state, for what we know as cloth to them is a new creation  but  is\nfactually the same old yarn only in a new form which has  been  created.  It\nis not sagacious or well thought out to assume  that  a  new  substance  has\ncome into being simply because of a modified condition.\n\nThus coming into existence and  disappearing  from  existence  are  modified\nstates of an ever existing reality. One of the conditions of  this  modified\nstate is its  appearance  called  birth  and  another  condition  being  its\ndiametric opposite is  known  as  death  which  by  disappearing  this  ever\nexisting reality  passes  into.  For  a  substance  which  is  intrinsically\nmetamorphic the process of modification is essential. As in the  case  of  a\nclod of earth, transformed into clay, transformed into  a  pot,  transformed\ninto dust and transformed back  to  earth  again.  The  manifestation  of  a\nsubsequent condition is but a modification of a previous condition and  that\nsame subsequent condition becomes a prior condition  of  another  subsequent\ncondition. Reasoning in this way it can be understood  that  it  is  natural\nthat  successive  modifications  take  place  in  regards  to  creation  and\ndestruction of physical bodies which cannot  be  avoided  and  there  is  no\nreason to lament due to this.\n\nIf there is some slight grief which may be apparent by the  passing  from  a\nprior modified state to a subsequent modified state  even  this  grief  need\nnot arise in the case of living entities such  as  human  beings  because...\nand the next verse 28 clarifies why.\n\n",

Such  alternations\nconstitute material existence and are a natural  law.  This  then  gives  no\ncause to grieve. Having just shown that even if one  erroneously  was  under\nthe misapprehension that the physical body itself and the eternal  soul  are\nthe same; there is still no reason to grieve as in the next verse 29  it  is\ndeclared that very rarely is a person found who would see,  hear,  converse,\nor who could be convinced about the wonderful nature  of  the  eternal  soul\nwhich is factually distinct from the physical body.\n\n",

Arjuna is asking how can he engage  in  battle  with  his\nsuperior Bhishma and his preceptor Drona. When even to  argue  against  them\nis improper then what to think against attacking them with deadly arrows  in\nearnest.  Why? Because preceptors and superiors are always to be  respected.\nDuryodhana by placing Bhishma and Drona directly  in  the  forefront  caused\nthe ever righteous Pandavas discomfort at the thought  of  having  to  fight\nagainst them as it was opposed to  the  time  honored  noble  traditions  of\ntheir family lineage. So what Arjuna in fact is stating is why  should  they\nengage themselves in  this  battle  being  aware  of  the  great  sinfulness\ndeclared in the Vedic  scriptures  of  disregarding  superiors  and  showing\naggression against the preceptor which results in the  perpetrator  becoming\na ghostly demon known as a brahma-raksasa.\n\n",
  "2-43": "Ramanuja.\n\n\nBhagavad-Gita: chapter 2, verse 45\n\nHere we see the word traigunya indicating the three  qualities  of  material\nnature being goodness, passion and ignorance. This term refers to the  three\ngroups of living entities characterised under the influence of  these  three\naforementioned qualities. If the Vedic  scriptures  did  not  address  these\nthree  classes  according  to  their  predilections   by   prescribing   the\nappropriate method for  attainment  of  the  heavenly  spheres,  then  those\nliving entities under the  influence  of  passion  and  ignorance  would  be\nadverse to goodness unwittingly hindering  their  own  progress.  Also  they\nwould be in the dark as to how to  advance  themselves  from  their  present\nposition and being lost compounded by being full of desires they would  fall\ninto degradation falsely fancying it to lead the way to their goal;  and  in\nvain they would be ruined. Hence the Vedic scriptures contain all  that  the\nthree classification  of  living  entities  possessing  different  qualities\ncould desire. But ideally  one  should  free  themselves  from  passion  and\nignorance and devote oneself to increasing the quality  of  goodness  fully.\nThis increase should be pure without any dilution of passion  and  ignorance\nall intermixture should be fully purged. The  word  nirdvandvah  means  free\nfrom duality, devoid of any  influence  of  material  nature.  Nitya-sattva-\nsthah  is one who is ever wedded to increasing goodness  without  any  trace\nof passion and ignorance. How is this to be accomplished? By being nir-yoga-\nksema meaning one  is  completely  unconcerned  about  acquiring  any  other\nadvantage apart from the realisation of the soul and  the  means  to  effect\nthat end. By this method one becomes atmavan or established in the soul.  If\none conducts oneself in this manner and  remains  fixed,  the  influence  of\npassion and ignorance will cease and goodness will become predominant.\n\n",
  "2-40": "Ramanuja.\n\n\nBhagavad-Gita: chapter 2, verse 41\n\nThe Supreme Lord Krishna is reaffirming that  the  science  of  yoga  rather\nthan the various methods of action prescribed in  the  Vedic  scriptures  is\nthe one path that has  guaranteed  certainty.  The  word  vyavasaya  derived\nfrom nischaya means certainty. The unshakeable conviction one has of such  a\ndecisive nature is that which the aspirant of salvation possesses and  which\ncan be understood  by  the  actions  they  perform.  The  strength  of  this\nunshakeable conviction is directly connected to one's understanding  of  the\neternal reality of the soul's immortality. Fragmented  and  not  evolved  is\nthat mind which entertains ideas of performing actions for  the  reaping  of\nresults. People of this type vaguely know that  the  soul  exists,  although\nmistakenly attributing it as being part of the body and  no  more  knowledge\nis required in their case as their material wishes for wealth and  fame  and\neven heaven can be obtained without having accurate,  precise  knowledge  of\nthe actual transcendental position of the eternal soul.\n\nBut on the  other  hand  the  conviction  of  certainty  is  unique  in  its\nsingleness of purpose and focused  aim.  All  actions  executed  by  such  a\nliving entity has for its sole objective salvation and  the  means  is  yoga\nwhich is the science of the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion\nwith  the  Ultimate  Consciousness.  This  is  the  essence  of  the   Vedic\nscriptures which lead to this conclusion and such being the case  there  can\narise only one unshakeable conviction to one possessing  spiritual  insight.\n\n\nFor the fulfilment of one single attainment being salvation all actions  are\ndedicated by one fixed in the firm  resolve  for  salvation.  Hence  as  the\nprimary objective of the Vedic  scriptures  is  one,  the  firm  resolve  as\nregarding the purpose of all actions can be but  one  as  in  the  case  for\nexample of the six different kinds of rituals called Darsa-purnamasa.  Three\nrituals are to be performed on the new moon and three are  to  be  performed\non the full moon. In  their  performance  they  all  differ  in  regards  to\nexecution yet they may be said to constitute a single aim for when  all  are\ndirected to obtaining a single fruit all there seperate differences  may  be\nunderstood as part of a whole.\n\nWhereas in the case of those with fragmented and unfocused minds who  engage\nin various activities each intended to acquire some result such  as  heaven,\nwealth, fame, power and so forth and so on the schemes are  endless  as  the\ndesires are endless. Even the results are diverse as in the  case  again  of\nthe Darsa-purnamasa, for although the rituals are directed to  be  performed\nfor the obtainment of a specific goal, yet they  confer  minor  benefits  as\nwell such as good health, vigor and long life. Thus it is  stated  that  the\nmentality of those not evolved is endless and ramifying.\n\nThe conclusion of this verse is that  all  nitya  or  daily  rites  and  all\nnaimittika or occasional rites for specific times prescribed  in  the  Vedic\nscriptures shall be performed with the sole aim  of  ultimate  salvation  as\nthe purpose. Although each rite individually is capable of  giving  its  own\ntemporary, material reward; but all such rewards are  to  be  ignored  while\nholding focus solely on salvation.\n\nAs for fruitive rites and rituals desiring some material benediction,  these\nshall be performed in the manner prescribed for the four varnas  or  classes\nof cultured life being brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, and  sudra  in  the  four\nasramas or stages of cultured  life  being  brahmacarya  or  celibate  life,\ngrihasta or married life, vanaprastha or renunounced life  and  sannyasa  or\ndedication and focus solely on the Supreme  Lord.  Accordingly  they  should\nalso resign the acquired results of their efforts in favor of salvation.\n\nIn the next three verses will be  seen  that  those  who  engage  solely  in\nfruitive activities are condemned.\n\n",

  "2-7": "\nIf as in the previous verse Arjuna has determined that  life  would  not  be\nworth living even if winning the battle then it  might  be  questioned  what\ndestined designation does he assign for himself? To this  query  Arjuna  has\nnow determined in his mind that unconditional surrender to the Supreme  Lord\nKrishna is the greatest panacea than any other  means  prescribed  in  Vedic\nscriptures. The Vedic scriptures reveal that He who  originated  the  entire\ncreation, from whose breath emanated the eternal Vedas for Brahma to  speak,\nthat Supreme Personality, omniscient and  effulgent  is  He  who  should  be\nsought for shelter. Also in the books of law in  the  Vedic  culture  it  is\nwritten that He who originated Brahma and protects the eternal Vedas  is  He\nthe Supreme Lord Krishna, all knowing and effulgent  who  should  be  sought\nfor shelter. Those who seek shelter of the Supreme Lord  Krishna  are  never\ndeluded. Lord Krishna is known as Janardana or He  who  always  removes  the\nignorance of His devotees. Arjuna has lost the power  of  discrimination  in\nknowing what is beneficial for himself and what is not.  So  realizing  this\nhe tells Lord Krishna that he is surrendering to  Him  whose  power  is  not\nknown  by  Brahma  or  Siva  and  whose   attributes   and   potencies   are\ntranscendental to the material existence. Who is an ocean of qualities  such\nas compassion and mercy and this Lord  Krishna  has  descended  Himself  and\nincarnated in the Vrsni dynasty in the family of Vasudeva  for  the  benefit\nof His devotees and all those who follow righteousness in accordance to  the\nVedic scriptures who are eligible to receive the  mercy  and  compassion  of\nthe Supreme Lord.\n\nAccording to Vedic scriptures one who dies in this  world  without  becoming\nself-realized is a  miser.  One  is  called  a  miser  who  is  desitute  of\nknowledge of the nature and qualities of their  immortal  soul.  In  worldly\nparlance one is known as a miser who is extremely stingy with  their  money.\nMiserliness here is the affliction  of  weakness  regarding  ones  spiritual\nidentity and integrity. Discriminatory power weakened  by  vices  forms  the\ndelusion which  bewilders  the  intelligence.  Arjuna  whose  ignorance  was\nremoved due to the compassion of the  Lord for His devotees,  realized  this\nand  unconditionally  surrendered  to  Lord  Krishna  with  the  words  tvam\nprapannam meaning surrendered unto you  and  asks  the  Lord  for  spiritual\nguidance as confirmed by the words sadhi mam instruct me.  Arjuna  qualifies\nhis own fitness to receive these  instructions  from  Lord  Krishna  by  the\nwords sisyah te aham meaning I am your disciple. This was stated  by  Arjuna\nso that Lord Krishna would understand that he was serious and not doubt  his\nintentions that he was a fit recipient for the  Lords  mercy  and  give  him\ninstructions out of His causeless compassion.\n\n",

It\ncannot be proven that having been before a kalpa the soul is  not  going  to\nexist after a kalpa. Such births and deaths at  the  beginning  and  end  of\nevery kalpa are told by the Agamas in  the  Vedic  scriptures  as  replacing\neach Brahma who manages and  directs  the  functioning  and  maintenance  of\ncreation in one singular universe in the infinite celestial  firmament.  But\nthis reference pertains only to the physical body and does  not  affect  the\neternal soul.\n\nThe imperishable soul  which  pervades  the  physical  body  of  all  living\nentities is aja or unborn and thus it is known to be  eternal  and  constant\nonly changing its  external  embodied   form.  The  two  characteristics  of\neternality and constancy denote that like the material substratum  known  as\nprakriti even the most subtle and infinitesimal modifications in  the  stage\npreceding manifestation has no ability in any  way  to  affect  the  eternal\nsoul.\n\nThe word purana means ancient.

From dementia comes loss of will power, one  no\nlonger  has  the  drive  and  incentive  to  cultivate  themselves   towards\nobtaining spiritual realisation of the eternal soul.

To these living  entities  no\nclear, definitive illumination in consciousness can develop; ergo ,  because\none will not be able to internally  realise  the  ultimate  reality  of  the\nSupreme Lord through the medium of the eternal soul as  having  name,  form,\nqualities, pastimes, abode  and  sweetness.   Thus  without  being  able  to\ncomprehend and contemplate on the nature of the eternal soul  there  can  be\nno tranquillity. Nor is it  possible  to  dispel  the  compulsive  urge  and\ninclination to experience sensual objects. To those who  are  not  tranquil,\nwho are  addicted  to  sensual  objects  and  who  are  submerged  in  sense\ngratification; how can they ever possibly  attain  eternal  blessedness  and\ntranscendental  bliss.

The elements combine to  form  the\nbody dictated by karma ato  render  service  to  the  imperishable  soul  to\nenable the living entity to experience the positive and negative  fruits  of\ntheir actions. In the Brihad- aranyaka Upanisad it is stated:  by  accruring\nmerit one becomes meritorious. A living entity is forced to  accept  a  body\nonly until all ones positive and negative karma is exhausted  and  then  the\nphysical body is no longer bound to exist in the physical plane.\n\nAs for the  soul  it  is  indestructible,  it  is  imperishable  and  it  is\ninconceivable. As the aggregate of all facets of consciousness the  soul  is\nthe subject and all individual facets of consciousness are the  object.  All\npervading throughout the body  of  every  living  entity  the  soul  as  the\ncogniser  is perceived by its unique  distinction  of  being  transcendental\nfrom the body. Nor can the soul be perceived as of a mutable  nature  as  in\nthe case of the senses. Thus by the fact of its all pervading nature  it  is\nverified that the soul is not  something  which  can  increase  or  decrease\nbecause of or due to aggregation. By reason of  its  all  pervasiveness  the\nfactual reality of the souls eternality is apparent.\n\nAs regarding the body because  it  is  subject  to  decrease  and  increase,\nbecause it is for the felicitation of the embodied soul in the  experiencing\nthe results of karma, because it is of multiforms and because it is  subject\nto decay it is destructible.\n\nSo it can be clearly seen that because the body is of  a  perishable  nature\nand because the soul is of an eternal nature neither of the two can be  just\nreason for regret. Therefore the Supreme Lord instructs Arjuna to bear  with\nfortitude the unavoidable sharp contact of  piercing  arrows  upon  him  and\nupon  others and thus going to battle as  a  matter  of  duty,  without  the\ndesire for any results, prepare his way for immortality.\n\n",

Although nature is seen as a force of action  actually\nit is supported fully by the underlying energy of the  Supreme\nBrahman. Actions though appearing to have a force of their own\nare only manifested through the instrument of matter in humans\nit is the physcial body.  The  Vedas  as  has  been  described\nearlier emanated from the imperishable Supreme  Brahman,  Lord\nKrishna.  The  words  sarva-gatam   means   all-pervading   or\nindestructible. This is indicative of the Supreme  Brahman  as\nwell as the soul within every living entity. The soul is known\nto be indestructible and all pervading. Through  the  auspices\nof the soul the physical body through  the  manifestations  of\nnature partakes of food and gains strength  becoming  fit  for\nperforming actions authorised by the Vedas. The word  udbhavan\nmeaning originates  from  is  used  to  illustrate  that  this\nfitness comes from the source from which one  manifests  from.\nEven nature is  only  able  to  operate  from  the  substratum\nthrough the utilisation of sun, rain, wind, fire etc.  and  by\nno other means. Therefore the all pervading and indestructible\natma or soul utilises a physical body which is its  substratum\nin the same way as the material nature to perform actions  and\nthat  without  a  physical   body  performing  the  activities\nprescribed  in  the  Vedas,  then  yagna  or  worship  is  not\npossible.\n\n",

Lord Krishna uses  the\nword sanga which means attachment this means that attachment will  be  there\nwhen the action is undertaken for self service but as  an  offering  to  the\nSupreme Lord one is free from  such  ulterior  motivations.  All  activities\nwhen done as an offering to the Supreme Lord with  anticipating  any  reward\nbecome consecrated through yagna or acts of worship done  for  the  pleasure\nof  atma-purusha,  the  Supreme  Lord  internally  within  the   heart   and\nexternally pervading  all  existence.

Actions\nmerely connected to  prakriti  or  the  material  nature  are  a  persistent\ninheritance from one's past activities in the unknown past. Thus to  perform\nactions comes easily as a natural phenomena and not subject to the  inherent\ndangers  of  possessing  an  impure  mind  or  the  lack  of  sense  control\nassociated the with jnana yoga,  the  cultivation  of  spiritual  knowledge.\nTherefore Lord Krishna is urging Arjuna to perform  karma  yoga  or  actions\nwithout attachment as in his case it is superior to  cultivating  knowledge.\nA-karma is non-action which implies cultivating knowledge by the  abstention\nof activities. But it is  known  that  it  is  not  possible  to  completely\nachieve the actionless state.  Even for the  followers  of  jnana  yoga  the\npath of karma yoga is superior because in jnana yoga one must follow a  path\none is naturally not accustomed, is difficult to practice, fraught with  the\nrisk of dominant senses  and  also  which  does  not  flow  as  an  inherent\ntendency like the path of  karma  yoga  where  actions  follow  the  natural\nlocomotion of the body in the course of daily activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther  it  will  be  shown  that  even  one  who  is  liberated  by  atma-\ntattva realisation of the eternal soul; still may be  involved  in  so  many\nactivities, performing actions without attachment or as a  matter  of  duty.\nThus even atma-tattva can be connected to material  activities  transforming\nthem to spiritual activities. Hence karma yoga can be superior in this  way.\nWhat can be inferred about the superiority of karma  yoga  over  jnana  yoga\nwill be evident to one who is actually engaged in practising jnana yoga.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut an alternative argument could be alright suppose one  is  determined  to\nabstain from all actions, then how does one expect to maintain their  bodily\nexistence which depends on eating and sleeping and  washing  and  exercising\netc. and by which the body is very helpful and useful in  practising   jnana\nyoga. The maintenance of one's physical  body  is  absolutely  essential  to\ncomplete the course charted in life until one achieves their goal.  The  way\nin which one maintains their body is by actions such as labour  by  rightful\nmeans to acquire funds for performing worship to God by  offerings  of  food\nwhich are subsequently imbued with spiritual potency  and  by  partaking  of\nthe remnants of such foods solely for bodily sustenance  each  day  maintain\ntheir bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Chandogya Upanisad VII.XXVI.II we find: It is by the purity  of  food\nthat one's mind becomes purified. When the  mind  is  purified  one  attains\naccess to the eternal soul dwelling within the heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nThus if one desires to desist  from  all  activities  how  will  their  mind\nbecome purified  and how will their bodily needs be maintained? Thus  it  is\nobvious that one who practices jnana yoga in order to maintain their  bodily\nexistence must still continue performing the  daily  and  occasional  duties\nprescribed in the Vedas until they reach their goal.  The  same  as  if  one\npractised karma yoga. Also in karma yoga the  contemplation  of  atma-tattva\nis also included in the conceptions that I am not my body perfoming  actions\nand I am not the actual doer of any actions. So for all these reasons  karma\nyoga is preferably recommended to jnana yogis.\n\n\n\nSo the conclusion is for Arjuna to desist and practice karma yoga.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if it is still postulated that actions such as the  acquiring  of  funds\ninvolves the my-ness  of this is my money and the I-ness of  I  have  earned\nthis by the strength of my mind and the  power  of  my  faculties  and  that\nthese efforts must cause bondage Lord Krishna refutes this argument  in  the\nnext verse.\n\n\n\n",

If  one\nshould steadfastly determine to perform absolutely nothing, still one  would\nbe compelled into action by the qualities of   the  the  three  gunas  being\nsattva or goodness, rajas or  passion  and  tamas  or  ignorance,  all  from\nprakriti, material nature. The effects of these have sprung  into  existence\nfrom one's past life activities. Thus by adhering to karma yoga the yoga  of\nactions without desires one's accumulated sins will gradually  dissolve  and\nthen mastery over the gunas and prakriti  is  achieved.  At  this  time  the\nmind has become pure and one becomes qualified for jnana yoga.

The  senses  are\nsuperior to the  physical  body  because  if  the  senses  are\nagitated they will transfer this  agitation  to  the  physical\nbody and knowledge will not arise in the  mind.  The  mind  is\nsuperior to the senses and can stop them but if  the  mind  is\nintent on sense gratification then knowledge will  not  arise.\nThe intellect is superior to the senses and the  mind  but  if\nthe senses are passive and the mind is not agitated;  then  if\nthe intellect decides contrary and is inclined  to  enjoy,  it\nwill overrule the senses and the mind and directs them both to\npursue pleasure. So knowledge will not arise there as well but\nwhen the senses are withdrawn  from  the  sense  objects  this\nimpulse subsides. So what is more powerful then the intellect?\nWe see that it is kama or lust  that  is  greater.  All  these\nthings happen in regard to physical activity. The mind becomes\nclouded and the intellect is obscured by kama and reflects and\ncontemplates actions that will gratify the senses veiling  the\ntrue knowlegde of the atma. This confirms  that  kama  is  the\ngreatest  enemy  of  the  human  being  because  it   obscures\nknowledge of the eternal atma or soul.\n\n",
  "3-27": "Kumara Vaisnava Sampradaya:",
  "3-16": "\nFrom food all creatures procreate and from rain food is produced. The  whole\nworld is witness to this. As for the evidence that yagna or  worship  causes\nrainfall sastra or the Vedic scriptures give proof. In Manu  Samhita  III.76\nwe find that oblations properly offered into the sacred fire ascend  upwards\nto the sun, and from the sun rain  clouds  are  produced.  Actions  such  as\nearning funds are accomplished by the physical  body  when  actions  utilise\nsuch wealth following the  prescribed  injunction  of  the  Vedas  then  the\nresult is yagna. The word Brahma here  denotes  the  universal  body  as  an\naggregate of all material particles. The word  aksara  means  indestructible\nor imperishable in the verse  brahma-aksara  refers  to  the  eternal  jiva-\natma, the individual soul. It is the jiva-atma who  monitors  the  body  and\ngives it consciousness and impels it nourish itself through food and  water,\nfortifying it to engage in the prescribed actions of the  Vedas.  Hence  the\nphysical body which serves as the medium for actions  is  said  to  manifest\nfrom the all prevasive universal body of  the  Brahman.  Thus  the  physical\nbody itself is the essential item which every votary of  yagna must  possess\nand is the indispensable prerequisite for the performance of  yagna.\n\nSo from actions comes yagna, from yagna rain, from rainfall  food  and  from\nfood embodied beings. This cycle was set into motion  by  the  Supreme  Lord\nKrishna at the beginning of creation. This cycle is  never  ending  and  was\ndesigned to exist perpetually providing all  necessities  for  the  embodied\nbeings allowing them to prosper and flourish, Whoever is born on this  Earth\nwhether they are performers of actions  or  contemplators  of  the  ultimate\ntruth, the Supreme Brahman; if they fail to adhere to and follow and  adhere\nto this cycle leads a sinful life for the simple reason that  they  fail  to\neven support and preserve their own embodied  existence  by  sanctifying  it\nwith the daily food remnants  eaten that was first offered in yagna.\n\nThe word agha-ayuh means full of sin, this can be either that one's life  is\ncommitted to making sins or that one is living a life perpetuated by sin  or\nit can even mean both. In this way such a sinner becomes an indriyaramah  or\none who only seeks delights in the beguiling  garden  of  the  senses  using\ntheir valuable human life only for the pursuit of pleasure,  a  slave  under\nthe control of  sense delights. Therefore such a one never takes delight  in\nthe soul and is the antithesis of an atmaramah or one who  delights  in  the\ngarden of the atma or soul.\n\n\n\n\nFood eaten that was not first sanctified by being consecrated  in  yagna  or\noffering of worship beforehand ignites rajas or passions in one and  incites\ntamas or darkness of intellect. A person  in  whom  these  dispositions  are\nprominent  becomes  hostile  to  achieving  an  even  rudimental   spiritual\nillumination let alone atma-tattva or self-realisation of the soul.  Such  a\nhostile person only finds pleasure in pursuing  pleasure  to  gratify  their\nsenses.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlessed with the gift of a human body which is suitable for offering  Divine\nworship  in  yagna  and  which  therefore  which  must  be  nourished   with\nsanctified food duly consecrated so ones actions fulfill there  purpose.  If\none errs and fails to honour and respect this eternal  cycle  given  in  the\nVedic injunctions, then all there hopes for spiritual realisation  will  not\nbe fulfilled and all their efforts are destined to failure.  There  complete\nlife was lived in vain.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo from this it can be understood that the  necessity  for  the  actions  of\nyagna as prescribed in the Vedic scriptures are essential and  indispensable\nfor the different varnas or castes and asramas or stages  of  society.  Only\nthat person who has attained moksa or complete liberation from the cycle  of\nbirth and death in the material nature is under no obligation to in any  way\nwhatsoever to perform any activity due to the fact that the  achievement  of\natma-tattva self-realisation of the soul has already been attained.\n\n\n",
  "3-3": "\n\nLord Krishna is telling Arjuna that he has not clearly understood  what  has\nbeen previously spoken by Him. He tells Arjuna that in this world  abounding\nin diversity there are two paths for two types of humans.   Jnana  yoga  the\npath of knowledge and karma yoga the path of  actions  each  suited  to  the\ncapacities and qualifications of the type concerned. Not all humans in  this\nworld  are born with the ambition for moksa or liberation. Neither  are  all\nhumans able to embark upon the path of knowledge directly.  But  all  humans\nmust engage in actions at all times they cannot stop but they  must  perform\nthese actions unattached without desiring any  reward,  perfecting  them  in\nthe process as factual activities  of  divine  worship.  Then  in  fact  all\nactions become divine activities as revealed forthcoming in  chapter  XVIII.\nverse forty-six worshipping God by  one's  actions.  Performing  actions  in\nthis way humans evaporate the inauspicious qualities lurking in their  minds\nand hearts and the senses give up  their  turbulence  and  become  calm  and\npeaceful. It has already been established in chapter II.  verse  forty-seven\nthat there must be no anticipation of rewards as the reason  for  performing\nactivities. When this platform has been attained then after  one  has  risen\nin wisdom beyond the turmoils of the quest of satisfying  one's  sense  with\nsense objects then jnana yoga the  cultivation  of  spiritual  knowledge  is\nappropriate.  In chapter II. verse fity-five Lord Krishna  has  stated  when\none gives  up  all  desires,  to  confirm  this  point.  Sankhya  refers  to\nspiritual knowledge or spiritual wisdom. Those who possess this  are  called\nsankhyas as  real  spiritual  knowledge  is  the  knowledge  that  leads  to\nrealisation of the atma or soul, firmly  resides within them. Those who  are\nineligible not fit for this course due to their own inherent  qualities  are\nthe yogis who are eligible for karma yoga the path of actions. So it can  be\nseen that there  is  not  even  the  slightest  contradiction  when  it  was\nasserted that for one who is beguiled by the  objects  and  distractions  of\nthe phenomenal world, karma yoga is suitable for them and for those who  are\nnot beguiled and able to renounce these objects and distractions are  suited\nfor jnana yoga the cultivation of spiritual knowledge.\n\n\n\nIt will next be shown that even if a wish for  moksa  or  liberation  arises\nstill one may not be  fully  competent  to  experience  the  cultivation  of\nknowledge  by  jnana yoga.\n\n\n\n",
  "3-2": "\nWhat Arjuna is trying to ascertain from Lord Krishna is if  the  cultivation\nof spiritual knowledge is superior to  performing  physical  activities  for\nthe attainment of liberation and  if  so  then  why  should  one  engage  in\nhorrendous activities like war and killing. It  is  well  known  that  jnana\nyoga or the cultivation of spiritual knowledge is the  means  to  accomplish\nself-realisation of the soul. Karma yoga or performing  physical  activities\nwithout  attachment  leads  one  gradually  to  jnana  yoga.  This  path  of\nspiritual knowledge can be attained by with drawing  all  the  senses  along\nwith the mind from the objects of the senses.  If  this  is  the  case  then\nArjuna is wondering why he is not being instructed in the cessation  of  all\nphysical activities; but instead he is being encouraged  to  fully  use  his\nmind and senses to engage in all of  the  violent  and  horrific  activities\nthat accompany warfare. Feeling confused by the conflicting instructions  of\nwith drawing the senses and the performance of actions, Arjuna now  wants  a\nsingle, unequivocal  instruction  to  determine  for  certain  exactly  what\ncourse he should embark to achieve the highest good.\n\n\n",
  "3-30": "\n\n\nDedicate thy mind and all activities to  the  Supreme  Being  in  the  heart\nrepresented by the eternal atma or soul within all living beings.  The  word\nnirasih means desireless.

Prohibiting all ego constructs of I-\nness and my-ness and relieved from the fever of mental  delusion,  discharge\nthe injunctions of the Vedic scriptures according to your  qualification  at\nonce as a matter of  duty  without  attachment.  In  this  Lord  Krishna  is\ninstructing the warrior prince Arjuna how he should fight his enemies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe words adhyatma-cetasa means with the mind absorbed in  the  atma  within\nthe heart. One's thoughts should be focused on the nature of the  soul,  its\nattributes and qualities as delineated previously in chapter two, verses  13\n- 25. There are many scriptures that reveal some of the  attributes  of  the\natma. In the Taittiriya Upanisad we find: Enveloped within the  interior  of\nthe heart, the ruler of all beings, the eternal  Supersoul,  the  origin  of\nall. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad we find:  He  who  is  residing  in  the\natma, He who is interior to the atma, He whom the atma knows  not,  He  whom\nthe atma knows not, He who rules from the interior of the atma,  He  who  is\nthe indwelling monitor, He who is the giver of immortality,  He  whose  body\nconstitutes the atma of all living beings, He who is the knower of  all  and\nis the inner guide to all.\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore we see  that  by  inference  that  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  is\nrevealing that since He is the atma within all living beings and  that  also\nthe atma within all created beings constitute  His  eternal,  transcendental\nbody and derive all their energy from Him;  then  it  is  natural  that  one\nshould dedicate all their actions to Lord Krishna, the Supreme Being  as  an\nact of yagna or worship.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne should very reverently reflect that one's atma is a part of the  Supreme\nLord and therefore He is within me and I am within  Him.  The  Supreme  Lord\nKrishna is the Lord and Master of all. It is He alone  who  causes  acts  of\nyagna to be performed by me to  Him  and  therefore  I  am  His  instrument.\nTherefore no  conceptions  of  I-ness  or  my-ness,  or  authorship  can  be\naccepted by me for any actions that are performed. Thus I will be free  from\nthe fever of mental delusion fuelled by the fire of illusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Paramapurusa is  the  Supreme  Being  and  Sarveshvara  is  the  Supreme\nController. In  the  Svetavatara  Upanisad  VI.VII  we  find:  Let  us  take\ncomplete shelter of the Omnipotent Supreme Lord, the Supreme Lord  over  all\nlords, the Supreme Ruler of all rulers, the Supreme Master of  all  masters.\nThe word isvaratva means lordship and the word niyantritva means  ruler  and\nthe word patitva means master denoting the relationship between the  Supreme\nLord and His servitors. In the Narayana Upanisad we find: He is the  Supreme\nLord of the universe. In the Brahma  Samhita  V.I  we  find  isvarah  parama\nkrishna which means that Lord Krishna is the Supreme Controller.\n\n\n\nArjuna was also reflecting on how he would become free from the myriad's  of\nsins about to be committed by him in the battle  for  all  the  warriors  he\nwould be slaying.  Now he is being instructed to cheerfully begin  the  fray\nperforming his prescribed duties as yagna or worship in karma  yoga  or  the\npath of prescribed Vedic activities  without  attachment  according  to  the\ninjunctions of the Vedic scriptures. By dedicating oneself according to  the\nedicts of the Vedic scriptures  one  is  actually  worshipping  the  Supreme\nBeing and the person who performs their activities in this  ordained  manner\nis automatically exempt from all reactions  as  the  Supreme  Being  Himself\naccepts their actions  of  offerings  as  His  own  and  accepting  complete\nresponsibility  of  His  surrendered  devotee  factually  frees  them   from\nbondage. Thus the quintessence of all the Upanisads has been duly given.\n\n\n",
  "3-21": "\nSo understanding that the whole  Earth  benefits  from  the  performance  of\nprescribed  Vedic  activities,  one  should  act  altruistically   not   for\nthemselves but for the welfare of  the  world.

This is in  conformance  with\ntheir material  natures  being  in  goodness,  passion  or  nescience  which\nsubsequently qualifies them for the type of occupation they engage in  their\nlife.

In as much  as  one's  own  activities\ndetermines their  karma  activating  what  reward  or  punishment  one  will\nreceive; then this is totally determined by each individual  themselves  and\nthus Lord Krishna is no way answerable  to  the  reactions  living  entities\nbring upon themselves  by  their  actions.

In the act of manifesting  the  creation\nLord Krishna is the original source but the instrumental cause  is  prakriti\nor material nature itself and the determining factor for all beings is  that\nthey come into their various existences as a  result  of  their  own  karma.\nExcept for the will from the original source of Lord Krishna no other  cause\nis needed to  manifest  myriad's  of  marvellous  creations  represented  by\nunlimited and diverse  variegated  beings.

The  fantasising  alluded  to  here  consists  of  the\nmentality which erroneously identifies the atma or  soul  with  prakriti  or\nmaterial nature along with the three gunas  being  the  modes  of  goodness,\npassion and ignorance and mistakenly conceives of  them  as  all  being  one\nprinciple.  But to that person seeking moksa or liberation all acts  regular\nand occasional performed by them and necessitated by bodily maintenance  are\nnot subject to reactions  being  devoid  of  desire.  Further  exemption  is\nguaranteed  as  the  aspirant  for  moksa  is  not  living  in  a  world  of\nimagination or fantasy because such a person  performs  every  action  while\nbeing cognisant of the eternal atma.

Being unborn He yet incarnates in  many  forms  whenever  and\nwherever He chooses whereas for material beings  they  are  forcefully  born\nimpelled by their karma  or  the  bondage  caused  from  reactions  to  past\nactions.

  "4-18": "\nAction is karma and inaction is akarma. Actions concerning the atma or  soul\nwhich is the essential subject to  be  known  in  human  existence  is  also\nconsidered akarma. How this is to be understood Lord Krishna  is  explaining\nhere. There are two categories to be considered.\n1) The person who performs actions   while  continuously  contemplating  the\natma \n2) The person who immersed within the atma perceives the atma  performs  all\nactions\nOne who by contemplating the true nature of the atma  while  performing  all\nactivities is in the  first category. One who conceives the  nature  of  all\nactivities as actually the doings of the atma is in the second category.  By\nactually performing prescribed Vedic activities with one's body and  at  the\nsame time meditating upon it within one's mind, the objective  as  well  the\nsubjective realisations are achieved and the true  nature  of  the  atma  is\nperceived. Whoever sees that karma is  within  akarma  in  regards  to  atma\ntattva or knowledge o the soul. Such a person is considered to  be  situated\nin wisdom and conversant with the ultimate purport of the Vedic  scriptures.\nSuch a spiritually intelligent person has realised the essence of all  Vedic\nteachings  and  has  qualified  themselves  for  moksa  or  liberation  from\nmaterial existence.\n\n",

The word divyam in  this  verse  meaning  divine\nconfirms that Lord Krishna appearance is not  the  same  as  the  compulsory\nbirths of the conditioned embodied entities  as  a  consequent  reaction  to\ntheir past life activities arising from  their   timeless  interaction  with\nprakriti or material nature. So in conclusion whoever understands  that  all\navatars  or  incarnations  emanate  from  Lord  Krishna  who  is   eternally\npossessed with all glorious  qualities  and  wonderful  attributes,  such  a\nperson is not subject to rebirth once they leave  their  present  body,  but\nattains the  eternal  spiritual  abode  with  the  Supreme  Lord.  Put  more\nsuccinctly such a person possessing accurate discriminative  knowledge  from\ndisciplic  succession  regarding  Lord  Krishna's  incarnations  and  divine\npastimes becomes free from all sins which stand in  the  way  of  coming  to\nHim. Such a person in  there  present  birth  will  attain  Him  by  placing\nimplicit reliance and full faith in Him in the manner described in  previous\nverses  and by making Him the be all  and  end  all  of  their  lives  makes\nthemselves extremely dear to the Lord which qualifies  their  existence  for\nattaining Him.

Lord Krishna is explaining that everything  used\nin yagna can be considered as part of the Brahman.  One  who  realises  that\nthe Brahman or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence is  actually\nabiding in all actions reaches the Brahman which is  becoming  cognisant  of\nthe spiritual substratum of reality underlying and pervading all  existence.\nThis is the consciousness of the actions  from  an  aspirant  for  moksa  or\nliberation where the atma or soul is understood  to  be  non-different  from\nthe Brahman. Consequently actions performed in this  consciousness  are  all\nknown to be spiritual and thus realised is in itself a means  for  achieving\natma tattva  or  soul  realisation  thus  precluding  any  further  need  to\npractice jnana yoga or cultivation of Vedic knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n",

There are even those  with  whom\na single moment of absence from  the  Lord  is  like  a  lifetime.  For  the\nprotection of these virtuous and holy beings, lest they in  their  agony  of\nseparation from me expire from this world, Lord Krishna bequeaths upon  them\nthe privilege of being able to perceive  His  confidential  appearances  and\npastimes  and partake in communion with Him. So  in  summary  the  following\nreasons of Lord Krishna's avatars or incarnations is: 1) for protecting  the\nvirtuous 2) for destroying the  wicked  3)  for  re-establishing  dharma  or\neternal righteousness which had become obscured. As dharma to all beings  is\nfactually the primary mode of worship for the Supreme Lord Krishna  and  His\nauthorised avatars in order to attain moksa or salvation from the  cycle  of\nbirth and death in the  material  existence;  it  should  be  known  as  the\nhighest good for all beings.

One  can\ndistinguish that authorship of actions are not  an  essential  attribute  of\nthe atma and thus  the  embodied  atma  shall  assign  all  actions  to  the\nauthority of the physical body. Then  remaining  content,  independent  from\nthe body one performs no action  as  a  consequence  of  being  a  passenger\nresiding within the body ceases to cause the body to act.

In  this  position  one  is\nalmost oblivious of the external world and has no urge  to  crave   or  hate\nanything and thus is also able to endure the dualities seeing  them  all  as\nthe same. Such a person is known to be constantly situated in jnana yoga  or\nthe cultivation of Vedic knowledge by  every  activity  and  is  incessantly\nexperiencing the bliss of the  atma.  Lord  Krishna  confirms  that  such  a\nperson easily performs karma yoga without effort and transcends  samsara  or\nthe cycle of birth and death.

The  word  ayuktah  means  not  united  with\nrenunciation and is unmeritorious and degraded. It can also denote  desiring\nmundane material rewards not connected to the atma. Incited by cravings  one\nlustfully desires the rewards of all actions. The actions of such  a  person\nperpetually binds them to captivity in samsara or the  cycle  of  birth  and\ndeath in material existence. Hence that  person  who  is  completely  weaned\nfrom all attachment to the rewards of their actions is able to delegate  all\ntheir actions as a product of material nature manifesting itself in form  of\nthe senses and their sense objects.

The\nconception of doership is derived from  contact  with  the  senses  which  a\nliving entity is coerced to accept from time immemorial due to past  actions\nin past lives.

The\nvariegated appearances of different species of life is due  to  prakriti  or\nmaterial nature not the atma.

Nor does  the\natma take the pious merit and happiness which may come to a person  that  is\nhated. The atma is transcendental to material nature and not limited to  the\nphysical body.  The  atma  knows  not  the  relationship  of  the  amity  of\nfriendliness nor the enmity of antagonism. All  conceptions  of  friend  and\nfoe are material designations caused by vasana which is  physical  instincts\ncreated from material association. How then is it  that  the  atma  is  thus\nshrouded by this  vasana.  Lord  Krishna  reveals  that  it  is  because  of\nignorance. It is ignorance which shrouds and obscures  spiritual  knowledge.\nIgnorance and nescience is that which is opposed to spiritual knowledge  and\nwisdom. By the shrouding of ignorance due to  reactions  from  past  actions\nthe  consciousness  of  the  atma  becomes  obscured  and  the  intelligence\ncompromised allowing the living entity to enter the perilous predicament  of\nbelieving they are the enjoyer of the rewards of actions thereby  recipients\nof the reactions. Thus by the karma or  the  reactions  from  attachment  to\nactions one forges a material link in the appropriate  physical  body.  This\nlove of one's body forges  links  with  other  bodies  kindling  a  ironclad\ninfatuation for the bodily conception.

By\nits eternal nature it is beyond the influence of actions and  reactions  and\nresides  impervious  to  them  in  its  own  nature.  This  atma  being  the\nindividual soul is not the originator in the material creation of  the  four\ncategories of living entities: the demi-gods, human  beings,  the  fauna  or\nanimal kingdoms and the flora  or  plant  kingdom.  The  atma  is  also  not\nsubject  to  any  activities  of  authorship  emanating  from   these   four\ncategories, nor any connection to the resultant reactions  of  any  activity\nsuch as descending into the animal species  or  ascending  to  the  heavenly\nspheres and becoming a demi-god.

By nature it  is  also  meant\nthe  illusion  of  authorship  and  the  terminal  habit  of  regarding  the\ntemporary physical body as a constitute of the eternal atma.

The\ncompound words yoga-yuktah is  one  who  has  achieved  communion  with  the\nultimate  consciousness  by  karma  yoga  or  performing  prescribed   Vedic\nactivities without attachment. The word munir or sagacious  is  one  who  is\nfocused on meditating on the atma or soul. Such a muni easily traverses  the\npath of karma yoga receiving atma tattva or realisation of the soul as  well\nas realisation of the Brahman or  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all\nexistence. But the person who is inclined  to  perform  jnana  yoga  or  the\ncultivation of Vedic knowledge finds this path extremely difficult and  hard\nto maintain. Because of this it takes an exceptionally long time  to  attain\nthe atma by this discipline.\n\n",

  "5-1": "\n\nIn the fourth chapter karma yoga or  the  performance  of  prescribed  Vedic\nactivities was delineated by  Lord  Krishna  with  special  emphasis  of  it\ncontaining spiritual intelligence. In the third chapter it  was  shown  that\neven those who follow the path of jnana yoga or  the  cultivation  of  Vedic\nknowledge  that  karma  yoga  when   performed   as   a   matter   of   duty\nwithout attachment was preferable.  This is because in jnana yoga the  level\nof atma tattva or soul realisation contained within each  action  determines\nindividual success; whereas karma yoga is  easy  to  perform  and  does  not\ndepend on atma tattva for success. In this chapter  karma yoga  is  examined\nin its efficacy of expeditiousness in achieving atma  tattva  in  comparison\nto jnana yoga. Also will be illustrated how this  should  be  performed  and\nthe eliminating the conception that one is  the  performer  along  with  how\njnana yoga is perceived from this standpoint.\n\n\n\n\n\nRenunciation and the cultivation of  Vedic  knowledge  is  jnana  yoga.  The\nperformance of prescribed Vedic activities is karma  yoga.  In  chapter  two\nLord Krishna declared that karma yoga was worthy to  be  followed  by  those\nseeking moksa or liberation from  the  cycle  of  birth  and  death  in  the\nmaterial existence and as the mind was subsequently purified  of  all  dross\nthen jnana yoga  would  naturally  be  embarked  upon  bringing  about  atma\ntattva. But in chapters three and four Lord  Krishna  explained  that  karma\nyoga was preferable to even for onme qualified to  perform  jnana  yoga  and\nfuthermore that karma yoga was sufficient in and of itself to  achieve  atma\ntattva without the help of jnana yoga. So the  conclusion  to  be  given  is\nwhich of the two is absolutely superior and the best means to  achieve  atma\ntattva.\n\n\n",
  "5-15": "\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the intelligence may be shrouded by the veil of ignorance still  it\nhas been seen that there are  those  whose  consciousness  becomes  awakened\nupon receiving Vedic knowledge.   The  veil  of  ignorance  is  due  to  the\nendless mass of accumulated  reactions  to  previous  actions  in  incessant\nlifetimes since time immemorial. Atma tattva or realisation of the soul  and\nsoul related knowledge derived from the Vedic scriptures  and  imbibed  from\nthe teachings of the spiritual master increases virtue and quality in  one's\ndaily life and is exceedingly pure. For this  it  is  necessary  to  achieve\ninnate  extraordinary  intelligence  or  supra-consciousness  which  becomes\nresplendent like the sun unlimited and expansive,  illuminating  all  things\nby the reality of their exact nature. The word jnanam meaning  by  knowledge\nand atmanah denoting plurality of souls confirms that by such knowledge  one\nrealises the Supreme Being.  It should not be contended that  the  plurality\nof unlimited atmas is upadhi or limited because no trace of  limitation  can\nexist once one's ignorance has been dispelled by  atma  tattva.    Spiritual\nintelligence in  itself  is  an  attribute  of  one  who  possesses  and  is\ndependent upon existence. The atma which is eternal is not an attribute  and\nis independent in relation to existence.  The  analogy  of  the  sun  as  an\nilluminator is to illustrate the relation between cognisance  and  cognition\nor the relationship between the knower and the known shown  by  the  sun  as\nthe source of light and emanation of light. Hence it can be  discerned  that\nin samsara or the endless cycle of birth and death in the conditioned  state\nthere is extreme limitation due to karma or  reactions  to  actions  and  in\nmoksa or the emancipated state there is an absence of limitation  due  to  a\nlack of karma..\n\n\n",

  "6-19": "\nIn verse eighteen Lord Krishna already explained  that  fixed  concentration\nin the atma or soul frees one from the  craving  of  sense  enjoyments.  Now\nreflecting that these enjoyments are  the  primary  oppressors  against  the\npractice of yoga or the science of the  individual  consciousness  attaining\ncommunion with  the  ultimate  consciousness,  and  are  very  difficult  to\neradicate due to latent  impressions  from  past  activities;  Lord  Krishna\ngives advice how to abandon them with the words  sankalpa-prabhavan  meaning\ndesires of the world. The word sankalpa is the  conceived  images  of  one's\ndesires. In the minds of the ignorant they are the forms of worldly  objects\nyearned for. They also include the latent desires in  the  memory  from  the\nremembrance of past experiences of sensual pleasures and enjoyments  in  the\nthinking of: I enjoyed that and I  want  to  enjoy  this.  These  ideas  and\nmentality are detrimental obstructions in the furtherance of  yoga  and  are\nveritably the root cause of misery and suffering. One  should  reflect  that\nthey arise from the interactions of the sense objects in material  existence\nand contemplating their banal and mundane nature develop a healthy  aversion\nto engaging the body and the mind in their sense desires.\n\n",

Sparsa-ja which arise  from  the  impulses\nof the physical body or and sankalpa-ja which arise  from  the  impulses  of\nthe mind or mental origin. Sparsa-ja includes desires for cold or  for  hot,\nor for sweet or for  salty,  or  the  lack  of  such.  Sankalpa-ja  includes\ndesires for wealth, fame, dominion, progeny and such. With great  effort  it\nis possible to abandon the desires of the mind by avoiding  to  think  about\nthem. It is also possible to resist the  sensations  of  pleasure  and  pain\nwith an attitude of indifference; but between the two  the  desires  of  the\nmind are more easy to abandon because  it  is  not  possible  to  avert  the\nsensations of  the  body.  Thus  it  is  necessary  to  comprehensively  and\nsystematically neutralise  the  senses  from  their  external  corresponding\nsense  objects.  This  should  be  undertaken  gradually  by  degrees   with\ndetermination and a resolute will. Then in due course of time the mind  will\nbe weaned from all things except the  eternal  atma  or  soul  and  absorbed\nexclusively in the atma, one thinks of nothing else.

Thus yoginam means more than just being a  yogi,  it\nmeans being a special yogi above  and  beyond  and  superior  to  all  other\nyogi's including the four yogi's described in  verse  twenty-nine  beginning\nwith sarva-bhuta-stham atmanam which refers to the yogi  who  perceives  the\nsoul in all beings. Verse thirty beginning  with  yo  mam  pasyati  sarvatra\nwhich refers to the yogi who sees the  Supreme  Lord  in  everything.  Verse\nthirty-one beginning with sarva-bhuta-sthitam which refers to the  yogi  who\nrealises the Supreme Lord as non-different from  the  atma  or  soul.  Verse\nthirty-two beginning with atmaupamyena sarvatra which  refers  to  the  yogi\nwho  perceives  the  atma  as   all   pervading   consciousness   activating\neverything. As the yogi indicated in this verse does not fall  into  one  of\nthe four mentioned classifications the  genitive  case  does  not  have  the\npower to place this yogi into one of those classes. The words  api  sarvesam\nmeaning amongst all types refers to  those  additional  yogis  indicated  in\nthis verse which follow the yoga paths of  karma,  jnana,  tapasya,  astanga\netc. Likewise also the genitive case of the word  sarvesam  meaning  of  all\ntypes, has the force of the ablative case which indicates this special  yogi\nis a bhakta or loving devotee of the Supreme Lord and thus greater than  all\nother yogis. In comparison with this special yogi  all  other  yogi's  being\ninferior can be grouped into a single class.  The  comparison  between  that\nspecial yogi  and  the  single  class  of  all  the  other  yogi's  is  like\ndesignating the special yogi as the Himmalaya's and all other  yogi's  as  a\nhandful  of  mustard  seeds.  Between  one  seed  and  another  upon   close\nintrospection differences  certainly exist;  but  such  differences  between\nseeds cannot be compared  to  the  difference  between  the  seeds  and  the\nHimmalaya's.

In this way he is always one with Him.\n\n\n\n\n\nSraddhavan means with earnestness and faith in the Vedic  scriptures  taught\nby the spiritual master. The earnestness of desire to  worship  the  Supreme\nLord Krishna comes from an intrinsic impulse which impels this special  yogi\nto find Him.

Lord  Krishna  is\nreiterating that for one who has not subjugated their mind this yoga or  the\nscience  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the\nultimate consciousness by dhyana or meditation  is  extremely  difficult  to\nrealise; but it is possible  to  achieve  by  one  who  has  the  vision  of\nequanimity towards all beings and  understands  that  the  same  fundamental\nspiritual basis is present everywhere as the atma  existing  in  all  living\nentities. Controlling the mind has already been elucidated by  Lord  Krishna\nin the process of selfless  karma  yoga  as  offerings  of  worship  to  the\nSupreme Lord. Lord Krishna has  also  instructed  in  chapter  II.XXXX  that\nthere is no loss or diminution by the performance  of  this  yoga;  but  the\ngreatness of karma yoga there described is  certainly  that  which  embodies\natma tattva and culminates in communion with paramatma the Supreme  Soul  by\nmeditation.\n\n\n",

In as much as this  His  maya\nor illusion permeates His prakriti or material substratum through the  three\ngunas or modes of  sattva  or  goodness,  rajas  or  passion  and  tamas  or\nignorance; so it is extremely difficult  to  overcome.

It  is  daivi  meaning\ndivine and is created by Lord  Krishna  for  the  purpose  of  sport  as  is\ndeduced from the root word div meaning to play. Its designation by the  term\nmaya is on account of its potency  to  produce  phenomenal  effects  in  the\ngross  material  existence  albeit  depending  upon  the  breadth  of  one's\nknowledge. These phenomenal effects are even manifested from  the  spiritual\nworlds as  in  the  case  of  Lord  Krishna  dispatching  His  intrepid  and\nimpervious Sudarsana Cakra  or  fiery  transcendental  disc  to  shield  and\nprotect  the  physical  body  of  His  devotee  Prahlad  causing  the   1000\nincantation manifestations to fail to harm him one  after  the  other.

The term mayair is  applied  to\nthat which is able to produce real impressions  upon  another's  imagination\nalbeit individual or collective. The effect is certainly real  although  the\ncause is definitely illusory. Like  a  magician  by  the  art  of  conjuring\nproduces marvellous effects upon the minds of those witnessing by  means  of\nincantations; so that when mayair designates  a  producer  of  real  effects\nwhich are not false, the word maya denotes  the  incantation  by  which  the\nmanifestion was effected. Wherever the term maya is  found  to  be  used  it\ninvariably means that which has the ability  of  activating  phenomenal  and\nmarvellous material effects and is universally accepted.  An  example  is  a\ncrate of Chinese fireworks is just another crate of dry  goods  lying  in  a\nwarehouse; but when activated by someone knowledgeable at night it  produces\nmarvellous and real effects in the sky. Whenever the word maya  is  used  to\nsuggest the illusion of non-reality instead of a real  impression  upon  the\nmind then such  application  is  only  figurative  and  subordinate  to  the\nuniversal understanding which  is  not  to  be  usurped  by  the  figurative\nunderstanding. When one reads 100 lances fought in battle it means  the  100\nmen who carry the lances. So like this in this way the word maya  should  be\nunderstood. This maya of the Supreme Lord  which  is  capable  of  producing\nsublime and marvellous effects which permeates the entire material  creation\nis the only maya to  be  considered  as  any  other  is  but  figurative  or\nmetaphorical. The Svetasvatara Upanisad states:  mayan-tu  prakritim  vidyat\nmahinan-tu mahesvaram which means  prakriti  the  material  substratum  then\nprakriti is to be apprehended  by  the  word  maya  and  mahesvaram  or  the\nSupreme Lord by the word mayi. It is the responsibilty of maya to  veil  the\ntrue nature of the Supreme Lord from the miscreants and unqualified  and  to\nlure  such  beings  to  constantly  chase  after  the   desire   for   sense\ngratification. Hence all the worlds  are  beguiled  and  bewildered  by  the\nintrepid effect of maya from the  time  they  are  born  and  thus  fail  to\nrecognise the magnificent splendour and wonderous  glories  of  the  Supreme\nLord  Krishna  who  is  eternity,  knowledge  and   bliss   personified   of\nimmeasurable transcendental nature.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next verse  will  give  the  means  of  deliverance  and  redemption  to\nalleviate this situation.\n\n\n",

Lord Krishna considers the jnani or the  knower  of  God\nas dear to Him as His own self and considers even that  His  very  existence\ndepends upon them. One may question how is this to be understood?  One  must\nunderstand that the Supreme Lord reciprocates in  the  same  manner  as  His\ndevotee acts towards Him. Thus in the same way that His devotee cannot  live\nwithout Him, He cannot live without His devotee. Therefore His devotee  atma\nor soul realised is His very life as the atma.\n\n",

There  the  subject  matter  primarily  delineated   was   with\nreference to how an aspirant may achieve atma tattva or realisation  of  the\nsoul by adopting the path  of  karma  yoga.  Atma-tattva  is  essential  and\nancillary to constant devotion and the continuous  meditation  necessary  by\nwhich communion with the Supreme Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His  authorised\nincarnations and expansions as revealed in Vedic scriptures as well  as  His\neternal associates. He is the ultimate and the supreme goal to be  attained,\none without a second and worthy of everyone's endeavour for devotion to.  He\nis Parabrahma the Supreme Being. He is niravadya or perfect, He is the  sole\ncauseless cause of the entire creation and the total  cosmic  manifestation.\nOmniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, infallible  and  eternal.  The  Supreme\nSoul  of  all  living  entities  and  the  Supreme  Controller  for  all  of\nexistence.\n\nNow the middle section of six chapters from seven to twelve  comprising  the\nsecond division of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita known as  the  Bhakti  Yoga  section\nwhich is the science of the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion\nwith the ultimate consciousness by loving devotion to the Supreme Lord.  The\nsubject matters revealed are the nature of Parabrahma the Supreme  Being  of\nAll, Parama Purusa the Supreme Spirit of all and the  method  and  modes  of\nloving devotion and meditation are to be offerred to Him. This is  known  as\nbhakti. The mode of such devout love called  bhakti  is  summarised  in  the\nfinal chapter eighteen, with the verses XXXXVI where  Lord  Krishna  states:\nThat humans attain perfection by rendering devotional  service  to  the  all\npervasive  Supreme  Lord  from  whom  all  created  beings  have  come  into\nexistence and from whom all created beings receive their life  impulses.  In\nverse LIII He states: That being completely detached from all  designations,\nfree from false ego, lust for  power,  arrogance,  desire  and  anger  while\nbeing completely equipoise and peaceful internally one becomes  eligible  to\nrealise and experience the Brahman or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all\nexistence. In verse LIV He states that when situated in  the  state  of  the\nBrahman one laments not and craves not and thus being joyful obtains  bhakti\nto the Supreme Lord.\n\nThis constant state of meditation  in  devout  love  for  the  Supreme  Lord\nKrishna or any of His authorised  incarnations  as  revealed  in  the  Vedic\nscriptures is known as bhakti and constitutes the method and means by  which\nto attain communion with the Supreme Lord.  This  is  confirmed  in  various\nVedic  scriptures.  In  the  Svetasavatara  Upanisad,  III.VIII  it  states:\nMeditating on Him solely one crosses over the ocean  of  mortality.  In  the\nTaittiriya Upanisad III.II it states: The knower of the Supreme  Being  thus\nbecomes immortal. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad II.IV it states:  The  atma\nor soul alone is to be intently contemplated on for deliverance and  in  the\nsame scripture beginning at I.IV it states:The  omniscient  atma  itself  is\nthe worshipable goal to attain. In  the  Chandogya  Upanisad  it  states:The\nmind being pure, meditation is stable, with concentration  fixed  all  knots\nare untied.\n\nThe Mundaka Upanisad II.II it states: The knot of the heart is cut  asunder,\nany lingering doubts are dissolved, all reactions to actions are  terminated\nto one whom the Supreme Lord has manifested within their  heart.  The  words\nbhakti meaning loving devotion and  dhyana  or  meditation  and  upasana  or\ndivine ecstasy and other similar terms are synonymous and indicative of  the\ncontinuity and potency of remembrance and reflection through realisation  of\nthe atma  on the Supreme Lord so intensely that  one  flows  into  communion\nwith Him as an actual perceptive experience. In the Katha Upanisad  II.XXIII\nit  states  that:  Not  by  deliberation  is  the  atma  perceived,  nor  by\nconcentration, neither by erudite knowledge. The atma is  perceived  by  one\nin whom the Supreme Lord Himself elects to reveal His  essence.  This  verse\nconclusively confirms that the path of Bhakti Yoga  is  of  an  ecstatically\njoyful experience which induces  the  Supreme  Lord  Himself  to  blissfully\nreciprocate with such a felicitous  devotee  being  that  he  has  made  the\nSupreme Lord the sole object of his love.  So  it  can  be  understood  that\nupanasa or divine ecstasy is non-different from bhakti or  loving  devotion.\nThat the terms upasana and bhakti are equivalent in  all  respects  is  also\nevident from  other  Vedic  passages.  In  the  Taittirya  Upanisad  III.VII\nbeginning tam nanyah pantha ayanaya vidyate it states: One who has  realised\nthe Supreme Being becomes immortal then and there, no other  path  to  moksa\nor liberation exists. In VI.LIII of the  same  scripture  beginning  na  ham\nvedaih it states: Not only by knowing the Vedas or  performing  austerities,\nor giving gifts or the performance of yagnas or worship in propitiation  can\nthe Supreme Lord be perceived. And in VI:LIV beginning bhaktya  tu  ananyaya\nit states: By loving  devotion  exclusively  is  the  Supreme  Being  to  be\nperceived and  known.\n\nThus the seventh chapter beginning the second division  of  Srimad  Bhagavad\nGita which is the Bhakti Yoga section delineates:\n\n1) The essential nature of the Paramapurua or Supreme Spirit  as  an  object\nof meditation.\n2) The mystification of the Divine nature by the veil of material nature.\n3) The resignation of oneself to the Supreme Being  in  order  to  transcend\nthis veil.\n4) The classification of the aspirants who have chosen the path of bhakti.\n5) The  pre-eminence  among  them  of  those  who  are  the  Supreme  Lord's\ndevotees.\n\nThe  words  mayy-asakta-manah  denotes  one  whose  mind  is  affectionately\nfocused on the Supreme Lord Krishna. So much so is one attached to  Him  and\nso impassioned is their love for Him that that if one feels  separated  from\nHim for even a moment either by being without His close proximity or by  the\nentrance into the mind of any thoughts not relevant  to Him; or if one  were\nto temporarily not remember Him for any reason, that would  subsequently  be\nthe cause of such a person to consider their whole life as meaningless.  The\nwords mad-asrayah means complete dependence upon the  Supreme  Lord  without\nwhom one could not even exist.\n\nNext learn about how one who joyfully engages in Bhakti Yoga with  a  loving\nheart in transcendental ecstasy will realise the Supreme Lord as  He  is  in\nall His splendour and glory.\n\n",

Inasmuch  as  the  very  realms  where   such\nactivities  of  enjoyment  are  unstable  and  transitory  then  it  can  be\nunderstood that the happiness and pleasures experienced there  are  fleeting\nand temporary and some time come to an  end.  This  is  inevitable.  To  the\ncontrary those who perform bhakti or loving devotion to Lord Krishna who  is\nomniscient and omnipotent and whom  the  complete  cosmic  manifestation  of\ncreation and dissolution is emanating from Him as mere sport. He who is  the\nmost compassionate, the most merciful,  the  most  enduring  being  eternal;\nonce His  devotees  attain  Him  there  is  no  question  of  rebirth  being\nreincarnated again in a womb in the material existence.

So one incessantly  meditates  upon\nHim. The words nitya-yuktasya yoginah is the enlightened one who yearns  for\neternal relationship with Lord Krishna. This is  the  jnani  or  knower  and\nlover of god to whom the Supreme Lord is very easily  accessible.  What  the\njnani seeks for his goal is the Supreme Lord only  and  nothing  else.  This\nmeans that it is not the elevated state  of  consciousness  of  the  Supreme\nLord that the jijnansur seek or the state  of  unlimited  fortune  like  the\nSupreme Lord that the arthathis or seekers of fortune desire.  The  goal  of\nthe jnani is to obtain eternal relationship with the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna\nor any of His authorized avatars or incarnations and expansions as  revealed\nspecifically in the Vedic scriptures.\n\nThe Supreme Lord is sulabhah or easy to achieve. This means Lord Krishna  is\nhappily available and accessible to all those who  are  devoted  to  Him  in\nlove and further more He, Himself  is unable to  bear  any  separation  from\nHis devotees at any time. Therefore it is He who chooses  to  be  associated\nwith them and this is the confidential tattva or  truth.  By  so  doing  the\nSupreme Lord Himself  quickly  carries  to  perfection  by  inspiration  and\nintuition the very method that His votary is performing for  attaining  Him.\nThe Supreme Lord Himself removes all obstacles which may hamper  His  chosen\nvotary from swiftly progressing to Him simultaneously  while  generating  an\nincrease in His devotees love for Him  to  propel  Him  onwards.  The  Katha\nUpanisad II.XXIII beginning yam evaisha  vrinute  tena  labhya  states:  The\nSupreme Lord is attainable by him alone whom He, Himself elects.  This  will\nbe explained further in chapter X, verses X and XI  but  now  the  remaining\nverses in this chapter will be focused on showing that there  is  no  return\nto samsara or the perpetual cycle of birth and death for the  jnani  who  is\nthe knower and lover of the Supreme Lord nor is there  any  return  for  the\njijnansur who has achieved atma tattva or soul realisation; but there  is  a\nreturn to samsara for the arthathi or seeker of wealth  for  they  have  not\nqualified for moksa or liberation from material existence.\n\n",
  "8-19": "\n\nThose  who  understand  the  succession  of  Brahma's  day  and   night   as\nestablished by the Supreme Lord Krishna applicable for  all  created  beings\nfrom human up to the highest  material  being  know  that  the  duration  of\nBrahma's day is 4 billion 320 million years and an  equal  duration  is  his\nnight. At the  dawning  of  Brahma's  day  all  beings  and  things  in  the\nthreefold regions of material existence along with their bodies and  senses,\nobjects of enjoyment and locations of enjoyment all in a subtle  form  issue\nout of an avyakta or unmanifest state emanting Brahma's  subtle  body.  When\nBrahma's night draws nigh all that issued out are all once again  reabsorbed\ninto that avyakta state of his  subtle  body.  The  exact  same  groups  and\nspecies of variegated beings adhere to the stringent law  of  karma  or  the\nreactions to previous actions are bound in the material existence  and  come\nand go. Appearing in Brahma's day and  vanishing  in  his  night  again  and\nagain perpetually.\n\nOne year of Brahma equals 26 trillion, 438 billion and  400  million  years.\nWhen the duration of Brahma's life which is 100 of  such  years  ends.  Then\nimmeadiately all systems of all material worlds in existence,  operating  in\ntandem or at random up to Brahma's own planet and even  Brahma  himself  are\nended and dissolve into the infinite.  This  dissolution  has  an  order  as\nconfirmed in the Subala Upanisad beginning: Prithivy  apsu  praliyate,  apas\ntejas liyante meaning Earth is devolved into water, water is  devolved  into\nfire. Fire is devolved into air etc. air is devolved into  ether,  ether  is\ndevolved into the cosmos, the cosmos devolves into avyakta  the  unmanifest,\nthe unmanifest devolves into the aksara the imperishable,  the  imperishable\ndevolves into tamas or darkness and the darkness merges  finally  back  into\nthe Supreme Being. Thus all things except the  Supreme  Lord  are  regulated\nand controlled by time. All things without exception owe their existence  to\nthe Supreme Lord Krishna, deriving their inception from Him  and  concluding\ntheir absorption in Him. In the  material  worlds  there  is  absolutely  no\nalternative to the cycle of birth and death. Thus at the  end  of  life  the\nforced relinquishing of material wealth and opulence for  those  who  wasted\nthere lives to obtain it is inevitable.  But  for  those  who  instead  used\ntheir precious human life to attain the Supreme Lord Krishna, having Him  as\nthere sole refuge and goal; for them rebirth is not even  to  be  considered\nas they are automatically liberated from  samsara  the  perpetual  cycle  of\nbirth and death. Next will be shown that there is also no rebirth for  those\nwho have achieved atma tattva or realisation of the soul.\n\n\n\n\n",
  "8-17": "\nThose who  through  the  power  of  yoga  or  the  individual  consciousness\nattaining  communion  with  the  ultimate  consciousness   understand   that\nBrahma's'day lasts for 1000 Maha Yugas. Each of which is one  cycle  of  the\nfour yugas or ages combined which are Satya  Yuga  lasting  1,728,000  Earth\nyears, Treta Yuga lasting 1,296,000  years,  Dvarapa  Yuga  lasting  864,000\nyears and Kali Yuga lasting 432,000 years all together  totalling  4,320,000\nyears. When multiplied by 1000 Brahma's day equals  4  billion  320  million\nyears. The same total applies also for Brahma's night. So combined  one  day\nand one night of Brahma equals 8 billion  640  million  years  and  this  is\nknown as a kalpa. One year of Brahma equals 360 of  these  kalpas  totalling\n26 trillion, 438 billion and 400 million. Brahma  lives  for  100  of  these\nyears.\n\n",
  "8-21": "\n\n\n\n\nLord Krishna now reveals His superior conscious avyakta or unmanifest  which\nis different in principle and substance  then  the  unconscious  avyakta  or\nunmanifest of Brahma which is non-intelligent and operates according to  set\nparameters. Lord Krishna's superior avyakta is characterised  by  eternality\ndue to its possession atma tattva or  soul  realisation.  Thus  it  is  also\ncharacterised  by  jnana  or  consciousness.  Avyakta  is  also   known   as\nindistinct because it beyond any perceptive faculty of the  mind  or  senses\nto cognise it as a perceivable reality. The purport is  that  avyakta  is  a\nprinciple of self-consciousness and as such  is  completely  unique  in  its\nnature. The word sanatanah meaning eternal because His supreior  avyakta  is\nnot subject to combination and aggregation or resolution and  disintegration\nand never disperses or dissipates when all the material elements  of  earth,\nwater, fire, air and ether in there rudimental forms  and  derivative  forms\ndissolve away although His superior avyakta abides within them. This is  why\nthe Vedic scriptures call it avyakta or indistinct  as  well  as  aksara  or\nindestructible. Those steeped in the wisdom of  the  Vedic  scriptures  have\ndeclared that this is the paramam  gatim  or  supreme  exalted  goal  to  be\nachieved. Lord Krishna previously mentioned aksara in verse  three  of  this\nchapter and will later mention it again in chapters XII.III and XV.XVI.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe superior state of avyakta is  where  atma  tattva  or  soul  realisation\nabounds and when once reached immediately precludes forever  the  subjection\nto union with matter again as there is no  more  rebirth  for  reincarnation\nhas been terminated. Lord  Krishna  specifies  their  destination  with  the\nwords dhama paramam mama meaning His supreme  personal  abode  of  eternity,\nknowledge and bliss where all things reciprocate fully with Him and  is  the\nabode of the liberated beings. The word dhama also denotes luminosity as  in\nthe light of consciousness which is the primary attribute  of  the  atma  or\nsoul. Thus Lord Krishna is indicating His  paramam  dhama  as  non-different\nfrom the infinite consciousness of the  atma  in  contrast  to  the  limited\nstate of consciousness one possesses who is oblivious to  the  atma  due  to\nbeing deluded by the illusory material energy known as maya  and  cherishing\nthe association of the senses with sense objects.  The other  avyakta  where\nresides praktiti or  the  material  substratum  which  contains  all  living\nentities and which is perishable is  controlled  by  Lord  Krishna  as  well\nthrough His manifestation as the eternal atma or  soul  within  the  etheric\nheart of all created beings throughout all existence. This is the  abode  of\nthe non-liberated beings. From the superior avyakta there is  no  return  to\nsamsara the cycle of birth and death. The next verse will show how the  goal\nof the jnani or knower of the Supreme Lord is  the  most  sublime  state  of\nconsciousness, more exalted than any other.\n\n\n",

The  next  verse  will\ndescribe the mode of meditation most suitable for the aspirant of  moksa  or\nliberation from material bondage.\n\n",
  "8-23": "\n\n\n\n\nNow the journey which is known as archir-adi  or  the  path  beginning  with\nlight which is common to the jijnasur the knower  of  atma  tattva  or  soul\nrealisation as well as the bhakta or loving devotee  of  the  parama  purusa\nthe supreme personality. The Vedic scriptures declare  that  the  archir-adi\nis the path by which both these types of aspirants travel  at  the  time  of\ndeath. It is the road travelled by  which  there  is  no  returning  to  the\nworlds of mortals. The Vedic  scriptures  when  explaining  panca-agni-vidya\nthe system of the five fires states: Those who have  realised  the  atma  or\nsoul, those who meditate on the Supreme Lord  with  full  faith,  those  who\nworship the Supreme Lord with bhakti or loving devotion. Those who do  these\nactivities alone in a private place reach the  archi  the  deity  of  light,\nfrom there to the deity of day etc. as explained in the  Chandogya  Upanisad\nV.II-XV beginning tad ya ittham vidur. One  who  travels  by  the  archi-adi\npath reaches Parabrahma the supreme  being  and  thus  returns  not  to  the\nmaterial worlds. This  is  confirmed  in  the  Chandogya  Upanisad  IV.XV.IV\nbeginning enan Brahma gamayati which states: He the servitor  named  Amanava\nto the appropriate demigod, escorts the souls who  have  achieved  moksa  or\nliberation from material existence to Brahmaloka  from  where  they  are  no\nlonger subjected to reincarnation in samsara the perpetual  cycle  of  birth\nand death.\n\n\n\n\nThose who have realised the atma are not in the same category as those\naspirants who diligently practice the para-vidya the supreme knowledge\ndeclared by Brahma because success in that is determined first by atma\ntattva or soul realisation. Otherwise if there was no difference between\nthe two then it would have been unnecessary for Lord Krishna to mention the\npath leading to rebirth and the path leading to no rebirth. The Chandogya\nUpanisad V.IX.I states: Thus do the waters come to be designated as the\nPurusa in the fifth oblation. Those who have performed righteous deeds and\nthose who have performed abominable deeds receive physical forms in\nconjunction and accordance with these activities and are fashioned out of\nthe five elements in which water is predominant. The atma is not these\nforms but just embodied in these forms by the dictates of karma or\nreactions from past actions. So this is the distinction and those who\nunderstand the reality of atma in this way qualify for the archi-adi and\nachieving moksa or liberation no longer return to the realms of mortal\nexistence. The conclusive understanding is that non-intelligent nature\nbeing material like the physical body is always fit to be discarded and the\nintelligent nature being spiritual like the atma is always fit to be\nembraced. Those who follow the spiritual   nature and realise the atma\ntravel the path of archi-adi and return not to samsara the perpetual cycle\nof birth and death.\n\nThe previous passage that the servitor Amanava escorts the souls to\nBrahmaloka is applicable to both the followers of the spiritual nature\nbeing the jijnasuh or the soul seeker and the jnani the god seeker, as the\nmeditation of the former consists of reflecting on the atma, devoid of\nmatter without any material conceptions as being one with the brahman or\nthe spiritual substratum pervading all existence,. This conforms with the\nVedic axiom known as tat krata-nyaya or that similar efforts yield similar\nresults; therefore when realisation of the brahman is the focus of one's\naspirations then one devotes themselves to contemplation of the brahman. So\nthe realisation of the brahman is achieved by dint of the aspirants\ncontemplation on the brahman. How exactly is the jijnasur to contemplate\nthe brahman is that they look at the brahman as ancillary to the atma which\nis the primary goal. Whereas the jnani meditates on the brahman as the\neffulgence of the Supreme Lord Himself and looks at the atma as ancillary\nto that, the Supreme Lord being the primary goal. Giving credence to the\nfact that the atma or soul is in reality part and parcel of the eternal\nultimate Supreme Being as well as the brahman is verified in the Brihad-\naranyaka Upanisad V.VII.XXII beginning ya atmani tisthan which states: The\nbrahman abides in the atma, by whom the atma is the body.\n\n",
  "8-8": "\nBy the daily practice of regulated meditation the  mind  becomes  fixed  and\ndoes not wander or meander away from the point of  focused  attention.  With\nthe mind so habituated and properly trained in meditation, the Supreme  Lord\nKrishna is to be fixed in one's mind as the final thought  at  the  time  of\ndeath up to and including the last moment. So thinking of the  Supreme  Lord\nat such a crucial moment as death is the pivotal point  in  human  existence\nfor one can thus attain Him in the spiritual worlds. This will be  explained\nin more detail in the next two verses.\n\nIt should be clearly understood that by thought alone one achieves  whatever\none desires, whether it is the Supreme Lord or dominion over the  worlds  or\ngreat fortune, etc. Whereas Jada Bharata left the human species  and  became\nan animal due to reflecting upon the welfare of a  deer;  a  person  by  the\npower of their meditation will be born  with  qualities  comparable  to  the\nSupreme Lord by meditating upon  Him  at  the  moment  of  death.  The  word\nabhyasa is the habituating and training of the mind  to  meditate  upon  the\nfocused object of attention in a  regulated  manner.  Whereas  yoga  or  the\nscience  of  the  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion  with  the\nultimate consciousness is a mode of meditation  with  fixed  procedures  and\nfixed times everyday abhyasa is a mode of meditation beyond the times  one's\nset  aside  for  regular  daily  and  special  occasions;  abhyasa  mode  of\nmeditation is more of a continuous phenomena in all activities of life.\n\n",

Whomsoever departs from this  life  at\nthe moment of death fixing the prana or life force in  the  crown  of  their\nhead in the manner so indicated  goes  to  the  exalted,  eternal  spiritual\nworlds.

More  evidence\nof this will be given later in this chapter in verses  20  and  21.  So  the\nmethod of meditation for those who are atharthi or seekers  of  fortune  and\nfor those who are jijnansur or those aspiring realisation of  the  soul  has\nbeen duly given being similar.

This state  is  aksaram  or  imperishable.  In  the  Brihadaranya\nUpanisad V.VIII.VIII beginning sahovacha-itad vai  tad  explains  that  this\nstate is not material. It is that which the ascetics of the  worlds  attempt\nto gain access to. It is that ardent longing for which men  strictly  follow\nthe vow of  brahmacaryam or voluntary celibacy.  Padam  is  that  which  one\nmentally proceeds to achieve the goal of their endeavours. Padyate  is  non-\ndifferent from gamyate meaning that  which  is  followed  being  the  method\nadopted by the mind. The purport is that Lord  Krishna  is  giving  a  brief\ndescription of the methodology by which  an  aspirant  for  atma-tattva  and\nmoksa  must  meditate  on  Him  to  achieve  the  ultimate  goal  they  have\nenvisioned.

One who when their life cycle has the Supreme  Lord  in\ntheir constant remembrance at the moment of  departing  their  body  attains\nthe Supreme Lord. The word mad bhavam means like  unto  the  Supreme  Lord's\nnature. Whatever nature of the Supreme Lord is vividly envisioned  in  one's\nmind at the moment of death that nature one becomes without  fail.  Examples\nare like the history of Jada Bharata and others who were  reborn  in  animal\nforms. He was attached to a deer he  had  raised  after  seeing  its  mother\nkilled by a tiger and at the exact moment of death looking at this  deer  he\nwas concerned about its future welfare and hence in his  next  life  he  was\nborn as a deer due  to  this  last  impression  of  consciousness.  This  is\nbecause the prominence  position  of  such  thoughts  and  images  in  one's\nconsciousness automatically direct and  transport  one  to  that  which  one\nenvisions.

This was applicable to Arjuna who was a  ksatriya  or\nwarrior from the royal line and it is his  duty  to  protect  righteousness.\nBut  it  also  applies  to  everyone  to  perform  their  prescribed  duties\naccording  to  the  injunctions  enjoined  in  the  Vedic  scriptures.

There is no doubt about this whatsoever.\n\nLord Krishna having explained in general for everyone that  the  achievement\nof a particular form and destination in the next life is determined  by  the\nvery last thought in this life, He will elucidate  the  different  modes  of\nmeditative devotion appropriate for each class and compatible with the  goal\nthey cherish to attain.

Such a yogi will travel by their own self\nearned divine path escorted by the presiding demigods of the path of light.\nThus one should with great faith and enthusiasm meditate on and perform\nselfless Vedic activities without desire that keeps one firmly upon this\npath. Daily meditation constitutes the proper performance of one's daily\nactivities as authorised by the bonafide spiritual master either Vaisnava\nor Brahmana from one of the four bonafide  sampradayas as revealed in Vedic\nscriptures.\n\n",
  "8-1": "\nIn the seventh chapter Lord Krishna discoursed on the nature  of  Parabrahma\nthe Supreme Being, Vasudeva the Supreme cause of all causes, the  object  of\nworship being:\n1) The spiritual sovereignty  of  all  living  entities,  sentient  and  the\ninsentient.\n2) The source and cause of all there is.\n3) The support and preservation of everything\n4) The ultimate reference of all language used as  an  expression  of  ideas\nwhich normally relate either to the Supreme  Lord's  rupa  which  is  His\nform, or His guna which are His qualities. The ultimate  reference  being\nthe Supreme Lord  Himself  of  whom  all  beings  in  existence  are  His\ntranscendental rupa and all things existing arise from His transcendental\ngunas. \n5) Isvara Parama or the Supreme Controller\n6)  The  most  exalted  and  glorious  by  the  possession  of  omniscience,\nomnipresence, and omnipotence, and by the possession of  all  power,  all\nbeauty, all knowledge, all opulence, all fame and all renunciation.\n\nThen  Lord  Krishna  went  on  to  explain  the  reasons  why  His   supreme\nindomitable nature is concealed and inscrutable for normal human beings  due\nto their committing iniquitous deeds in past lives from time immemorial  and\nalso being addicted to gratification of desires with the delights which  the\nphysical body and five senses stimulate while  being  covered  with  varying\ndegrees of the triple qualities of sattva or goodness, rajas or passion  and\ntamas or ignorance.\n\nLord Krishna then revealed by what means this illusionary  delusion  can  be\nremoved by an embodied being who develops firm faith  in  the  Supreme  Lord\nand surrenders to  Him,  due  to  the  grace  of  the  spiritual  master  in\nVedically authorised disciplic succession. This  faith  and  resignation  to\nthe Supreme Lord manifests in following the instructions  of  the  spiritual\nmaster and results in the  performance  of  highly  meritorious  activities.\nLord Krishna also showed how the differences in merit  produces  differences\nin results for  different  aspirants  being  the  atharthis  or  seekers  of\nfortune, the jijnansur or aspirants for realisation of the soul and  jnani's\nor seekers of the Supreme Lord. It was also  shown  how  out  of  all  these\naspirants the jnani was the most exalted. The eminence of  the  jnani's  was\nderived from their constant devotion and unwavering  love  for  the  Supreme\nLord exclusively, thus they became an object of the Supreme Lord  who  loves\nto reciprocate, warmest affection; but such a devotee of  the  Supreme  Lord\nis rarely seen and very  difficult  to  find.  In  conclusion  Lord  Krishna\nmentioned several requisites of knowledge  which  the  three  classes  being\natharthi's, jijnansur's and jnani's have to be knowledgeable of and  act  in\naccordance to in order to realise the individual goals  of  future  felicity\nwhich each class aspires for.

This is  what  Lord  Krishna  is  stating  in  this\nverse. Their final thought  will  become  form.  One's  final  thought  will\nnaturally be what was constantly  reflected  upon  and  mediated  on  during\ntheir span of life based upon one's association and daily habits.\n\n",
  "8-3": "\n\n\n\n\nWhat is designated in verse one as  tad  brahma  or  the  supreme  spiritual\nsubstratum pervading all existence is the aksaram  paramam  or  the  supreme\nindestructible atma or soul.  Aksaram is that which is not subject to  decay\nor imperishable and is the collective given by  the  ksetrajnanis  or  those\nknowledgeable of the field of action or the informers of  uninformed  matter\nand atma  embodied  beings.  The  Subala  Upanisad  II  states  avyakta  the\nindiscernible compound of spirit and  matter  merges  into  the  aksara  the\nindivisible compound which descends into tamas or nescience. Parama  aksaram\nis the superior indestructible atma nature which  is  completely  disengaged\nfrom prakriti or the material substratum  and  not  connected  to  even  the\naksaram  which  comprises  embodied  beings  and  combines  both.  The  word\nsvabhavo is also called adhyatma and indicates subtle material elements  and\nits accompanying erratic tendencies. These subtle elements are what  adheres\nto the atma in the descent of  the  supra  subtle  quintuple  process  from\nspirit to matter, the last being the fifth stage which becomes  the  seminal\nfluids referred to in the Panca-agni-vidva or  five-fold  sacrificial  fires\nwhich are described in the Chandogya  Upanisad:V.III-X  which  is  essential\nand has to be known by all aspirants.  Both  aksara  and  adhyatma  must  be\nrealised by the mumumkshus or emancipation seekers for moksa  or  liberation\nfrom material existence as aksara the immortal soul is that what  is  worthy\nof selection and adhyatma the  embodied  being  incarcerated  in  matter  is\nworthy of rejection. The sequence which manifests this descent  into  matter\nby the jiva or embodied being is called visargah and karma  refers  to  that\nspecific action which activates a corresponding reaction and determines  the\ndestination and manifestation of all creatures into embodied states  whether\nhuman,  animal,  fish  etc.  The  final   action   which   actually   causes\nmanifestation into material existence is known as procreation between  males\nand females of different species. The Vedic scriptures declare that  in  the\nfifth stage the male discharges  the  sacrificial  water  into  the  females\nsacrificial fire and a new embodied being is created. This act is  known  as\nkarma. The knowledge of karma, aksara and adhyatma are all prerequisites  of\nknowledge absolutely essential for those seeking moksa  or  liberation  from\nthe material existence. Otherwise one will be ignorant of what is worthy  of\nrejection and what is worthy of attention and unable  to  properly  interact\naccordingly. An example is following in verse 11 concerning  brahmacarya  or\ncelibacy.\n\n\n\n\n",

All  these\nthings must certainly be comprehended and contemplated by them.\n\nThe word adhidaivatam refers  to  the  purusha  or  the  ultimate,  original\nsupreme being whose status is superior and elevated above  the  330  million\ndemigods and all other celestials and lesser divinities and  gods  as  well.\nThis is the Supreme Lord Krishna who is the possessor  and  enjoyer  of  all\nthe  supramundane  enjoyments  of  rare  and  equisite   delights   of   His\ntranscendental senses of sound and sight etc as the  ultimate  recipient  of\nall yagna or worship and propitiation, even more then  that  experienced  in\nthe heavenly planets by  Indra  and  Brahma.  The  aivaryarthis  or  fortune\nseekers must meditate on the purusha  as  the  Supreme  Being  and  ultimate\nenjoyer of all the subtle  transcendental  delights  and  this  is  what  is\ncalled knowing the adhidaivatam.\n\nThe adhiyagna denotes the Supreme Lord Krishna, Himself. It  is  He  as  the\nindwelling monitor in all the demigods  and  other  gods  and  all  sentient\nbeings and whose total aggregate of atmas or eternal  souls  constitute  His\ntranscendental, spiritual body and as such  He receives  first  worship  and\npropitiation from all yagnas. Thus as the adhiyagna  he  is  the  indwelling\nmonitor established in the heart of all beings and He is the  one  whom  the\nthree classes of devotees have to realise and meditate upon as a maha  yagna\nor great offering in all their nitya and namaitta or eternal and  occasional\nacts of worship.\n\n",

For this reason as  stated  previously  all  the  330  million\ndemigods comprise the body of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  and  within  the\netheric heart of each He is residing as paramatma the Supreme Soul  as  also\nwithin all living entities.

Hence because they  worshipped  indirectly  they  are  entitled  to\nindirect recompense because it descends from  the  Supreme  Lord  back  down\nthrough the demigods who taking their  share  bestow  whatever  mundane  and\ntransitory desire the ritual was  performed  for  such  as  entry  into  the\nheavenly planets and because such a boon is not eternal  when  the  allotted\ntime fo enjoyment has expired they will be recycled back  into  samsara  the\nperpetual cycle of birth and death again as mortals.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be clearly understood that although the Vedic scriptures  directly\nenjoin  worship  of  the  demigods  they  also  explain  that  the  demigods\nconstitute the transcendental body of the Supreme Lord and that  He  is  the\nspirit soul within each and  every  one  of  them  as  well   and  thus  the\nspiritually intelligent mahatmanas or great souls easily understand that  by\nworshipping the Supreme Lord  all the demigods are automatically  worshipped\nas well and thus with great love and devotion they exclusively  worship  the\nSupreme Lord Krishna or any of His authorised  incarnations  and  expansions\nas revealed in Vedic scriptures.\n\n\n",

The word gatim denoting  destination  comes  from\nthe words gat - agatam  meaning transitory states with  no  permanence  this\ninfers that the enjoyments of Swargaloka are  of  a  trivial  and  temporary\nnature involving  a  revocation  and  termination.  Whereas  the  mahatmanas\nhanker only for the Supreme Lord, giving themselves completely in bhakti  or\nardent loving devotion to Him  and thus they assuredly achieve  the  eternal\nspiritual worlds never returning and attain the Supreme Lord Krishna who  is\nimmeasurable, inexpressible and inconceivable annada or  bliss  personified.\nAdditional characteristics distinguishing the mahatmanas is given next.\n\n\n",
  "9-15": "\n\n\n\n\nThe mahatmanas or those of great souls discuss,  sing  and  reflect  on  the\nglories of Lord Krishna without abatement in what is  called  jnana  yagnena\nor propitiation by  knowledge.  How  is  this  to  understand?  By  constant\nmeditation of Him  as  the  unity  comprising  the  infinite  variations  of\nunlimited diversity displayed in creation as the form  of  the  cosmos.  The\nessence of understanding this phenomena is  as  follows.  The  Supreme  Lord\nKrishna alone is the sum total of all having within His spiritual  body  the\nmost fine and supra subtle state chit or  the  principles  of  consciousness\nand  also  that  of  achit  or  inconsciousness  without  names,  forms  and\ndistinctness. By His indomitable will the Supreme Lord resolves to  manifest\nfrom  His  spiritual  body  consciousness  and  inconsciousness  into  their\nrelative material states having names,  forms  and  distinctness.  Thus  the\nSupreme Lord  Himself  being  the  totality  of  all  is  perceived  in  His\nmanifested cosmic form exhibiting the marvelous  variegations  of  existence\nsuch as the heavenly demigods, humans, flora, fauna and aquatic as  well  as\nthe stationary kingdoms. Contemplating the Supreme  Lord  as  all  inclusive\nthey are worshipping Him. Therefore He  is  declared  to  be  the  universal\nform.\n\n\n",
  "9-5": "\nLord Krishna states unequivocally na bhuta-stah meaning  that  He  does  not\nderives any  support  whatsoever  from  the  myriads  of  unlimited  created\nsentient  and  insentient  beings.  He  is  supremely  independent  and   He\nspecifically states that He is not upheld by them in any  manner  like  that\nof a vessel upholding water. It is by His will alone that  He  supports  and\nenergises all existence. Just marvel on the wonder of His yoga  aisvaram  or\ndivine supernatural power which is so fantastic  and  phenomenal  and  which\nthere is no comparison in any form any where else in the  past,  present  or\nfuture. What is this divine, supernatural power which is so mysterious  that\nit controls, organises and directs all of creation with natural  perfection.\nThe word mamatma means by His own soul being for Him paramatma  the  Supreme\nSoul residing in all beings and this opulent of  abundance  constitutes  the\npower of His will which alone is the cause of all existence. So He is bhuta-\nbhrt or the support of all existence and bhuta-bhavanah  the  protector  of\nexistence or that by which an order of  existence  is  established.  In  the\nnext verse an example will be given to emphasise how all things depend  upon\nLord Krishna's will for their existence.\n\n",
  "9-19": "\n\nThe Supreme Lord Krishna explains some of His  potencies  that  through  the\nsun and fire He is tapami or causes  heat  and  He  withholds  and  releases\nrain. He is amrtam or immortality being by which the  world  exists.  He  is\nalso mrtyus or death that by which this world becomes  destroyed.  Never  in\ncontradiction the Supreme Lord is sat or that existence  which  manifest  in\nthe present time and asat or that existence which is unmanifest  in  present\ntime but which existed in the past and which may  manifest  in  the  future.\nThus Lord Krishna  exists  in  every  reality  as  the  sum  of  all  things\nintelligent and unintelligent which compose  His  transcendental  body.  The\nmahatmanas or great, noble beings referred to in  verse  13  are  those  who\nmeditate on the Supreme Lord as the unity, manifesting itself  in  corporeal\nmultiformity and variegatedness   throughout  creation  in  the  macrocosmic\nsense. So in order to more fully understand the attributes  of  the  Supreme\nLord characterized by the mahatmanas and the method they  commune  with  the\nSupreme Lord has been depicted.

He is vedyam whatever is  perceptible  by  the\nVedas being worthy to be known and He is the  Holy  sanctifier.

  "9-11": "\n\n\n\n\nDue to the accumulation of unlimited sins by ignoring the ordinances of  the\nVedic scriptures, ignorant fools mistake the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  to  be\nperishable like any  other  member  of  humanity.  Such  fools  are  totally\nincognisant to the reality that Lord  Krishna  is  the  Supreme  omniscient,\nomnipresent and omnipotent Lord of all creation and that  He  manifests  His\noriginal form that appears to be like all of  humanity  due  to  magnanimous\nfeelings of infinite compassion in order for all living entities to be  able\nto have access to Him. Oblivious to Lord Krishna's eternal,  transcendental,\nimmutable and supreme nature disguised in human form as  a  way  to  display\nHis phenomenal lilas or divine pastimes by which to inspire and delight  all\nof humanity as an act of unlimited mercy and love for all. Yet although  all\nover the Earth the name of Lord Krishna and His avatars  or  expansions  and\nincarnations has been heard of by all, still  the  ignorant  and  irrational\neven after hearing of Him foolishly disregard and disrespect Him  as  if  He\nwere just an ordinary mortal being.\n\n\n",
  "9-4": "\nThe complete cosmic creation constituted of variegated  myriad  of  sentient\nand insentient beings is permeated by the Supreme Lord  Krishna.  The  words\navyakta-murttina  mean  His  subtle  form  manifested  as  the  brahman   or\nspiritual substratum pervading all existence. It  is  indiscernible  by  the\nmaterial senses and  is  unable  to  be  perceived  by  the  mind.  Although\nsecretly hidden, He is manifested internally in the unrivalled  presence  of\nparamatma the purely spiritual  supreme  soul  in  everything  sentient  and\ninsentient. So in spirit He pervades everywhere. Lord Krishna does  this  in\nrelation to universal creation as the Supreme Sovereign Lord manifesting  it\nand also by maintaining and sustaining it. As stated in  the  Brihadaranyaka\nUpanisad V.VII.III beginning ya prithivyam tishtham  or  He  who  abides  in\nearth but whom earth knows not and He to whom in the interior  of  earth  is\nsovereign ruler  and  in  verse  V.VII.XXII  beginning  ya  atmani  tishtham\nmeaning He who resides in the soul but the soul knows not  and  He  to  whom\nthe soul is the body who from the interior of the soul is  sovereign  ruler.\nBoth verses confirm His supreme presence and pervasive nature in  everything\nwhich is sentient  as  well  as  insentient;  but  totally  unperceived.  By\nreference to earth,  body,  soul  establishes  complete  compliance  to  His\nsovereign rulership and establishes the dependence of all  things  upon  Him\nas they derive their very existence  from  Him.  Hence  all  existences  and\neverything existing in all existences have their abode  within  the  Supreme\nLord.\n\n",
  "9-31": "\n\nBy bhakti or loving  devotion  rendered  exclusively  to  the  Supreme  Lord\nKrishna for His  satisfaction  alone  without  any  thought  of  reward  one\nbecomes ecstatically transformed by such intense love and  by  this  one  is\nfirmly fixed in sattva guna the mode of goodness with  all  traces  of  raja\nguna the mode of passion and tama guna the mode of ignorance rooted out.  In\nthis way one is ksiprin or speedily, divested of all  sinful  reactions  and\nbecomes dharmatma or a righteous soul, worthy of praise by all. Such is  the\nposition of one  who  becomes  an  unadulterated  devotee  of  Lord  Krishna\nworshipping  Him  exclusively.  It  is  this  exclusive  devotion  that  was\nreferred to in verse three of this chapter with  the  word  dharmasyasya  or\npure eternal righteousness. A person performing bhakti goes to  the  sublime\neternal state of the spiritual worlds from whence  there  is  no  return.  A\nstate where all energy and effort contrary to  attaining  the  Supreme  Lord\nceases. Here Lord Krishna gives encouragement to Arjuna  to  boldly  declare\nHis statements with certitude that whoever is an  unadulterated  devotee  of\nLord Krishna  never perishes or is ever vanquished even if such  a  one  was\npossessed in the past  with  a  demeaning  character  degraded  by  inimical\nactions. The paramount virtue of  bhakti  or  loving  devotion  is  that  it\ncompletely  destroys  anything  that  is  opposed  to  bhakti   and   having\neradicated all karma or reactions  to  previous  actions  one  achieves  the\neternal position of moksa or freedom from the material  existence  and  thus\nsuch a devotee becomes irrevocably imbued with deep  and  lasting  love  and\ndevotion to the Supreme Lord.\n\n",
  "9-34": "\n\nThe words man mana means be always conscious of  Lord  Krishna.  This  means\none's consciousness should always be focused on Him as a  continuous  stream\nof thought. The Supreme Lord of all,  the  sole  abode  of  all  excellence,\ndevoid of any fault, the  omniscient,  omnipotent  and  omnipresent  One  of\nindomitable will. The Supreme Lord Krishna, the sole source, the sole  cause\nand the sole  origin  of  all  creation,  who  is  Parabrahman  the  supreme\nmanifestation of  the  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  and\nPurusottama the supreme personality, who possesses large,  beautiful,  lotus\nshaped eyes and whose transcendental body is of dark blue  complexion.  Lord\nKrishna resplendent as 1000 suns simultaneously shining,  Lord  Krishna  the\nepitome of all beauty and loveliness with  effulgent  yellow  hued  raiment,\nornate and immaculate diadem, dolphin shaped  earrings,  celestial  garlands\nand ungents, bracelets, rings and armlets. Lord Krishna  isvara  parama  the\nultimate controller of all, who is an ocean of infinite  mercy,  compassion,\nbeauty, sweetness, perfection, bounty  and  affection.  The  refuge  of  all\nplanes  of  existence  in  all  the  trillions  of  universes  without   any\ncontradiction in any of them regardless of uniqueness and differences.  Lord\nKrishna the Supreme Sovereign Lord of all.\n\nFurthemore one should be mad bhakto or have  their  consciousness  permeated\nwith unadulterated love for Lord Krishna as their beloved friend.  Then  one\nshould become maj yaji or Lord Krishna's  devoted  worshipper  taking  great\ndelight in their intimate and individual relationship with the Supreme  Lord\ninternally. Yaja denoting yagna indicates all the myriad  of  wonderful  and\nsublime ways of offering bhakti or loving devotion unto  Lord  Krishna,  the\nway a dear friend offers everything they  possess  to  please  another  dear\nfriend. Offering as yaji is of three kinds.\n\n1) aupacharika is external worship such as offering incense and waving  ghee\nlamps,  fanning etc.\n2) samsparsika is tactual service  such  as  garlanding,  applying  ungents,\nsmearing sandalwood paste, etc.\n3) abhyaaharika is offering  of  vegetarian  food  such  as  milk  products,\nfruits and vegetables.\n\nYaji is thus rendering all kinds of pleasing  and  delectable  services  for\nLord Krishna's supreme satisfaction and  this  whether  great  or  small  is\naccomplished perfectly by bhakti  or loving devotion and by no other  means.\nThe purport is: Let my mind be so aligned that it  takes  great  delight  in\nalways rendering such pleasing services to the Supreme Lord Krishna.\n\nNext is advised namaskuru which is the humble prostration of obeisance  unto\nthe Supreme Lord. This infers to not let  one's  mind  merely  bask  in  the\nsatisfaction of rendering service out of infinite love created  by  communal\nbliss with the Supreme Lord but  to  also  be  prostrated  in  homage   with\nhumility to the Supreme Lord as the internal  monitor  within  as  Paramatma\nthe supreme soul who witnesses all thought and activities  of  every  living\nentity.\n\nMat-parayanah means one who has totally surrendered  to  the  Supreme  Lord.\nWho accepts the Supreme Lord as  their  only  shelter  and  refuge  and  who\nindependent of Him could not tolerate  existence  therefore  such  a  person\ndepends completely on  Him.  Thus  disciplining  the  consciousness  in  one\npointed focus so that  everything  one  does  is  directly  related  to  the\nSupreme Lord one should guide their consciousness in such a way that it  can\nrevel and delight in personal communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord  at  every\nmoment. Possessed of such a wonderfully evolved spiritualised  consciousness\nthou shalt most assuredly attain the Supreme Lord  without  fail.  The  word\natma used here denotes the consciousness beyond the mind.\n\nThe import of this verse is that if a person  prepares  and  develops  their\nconsciousness to meditate on the Supreme Lord, to render loving  service  to\nthe Supreme Lord,  to  delight  in  communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord,  to\nprostrate in humble homage to the Supreme  Lord,  then  putting  their  full\ntrust to Him alone they will undoubtedly attain Him.\n\nSo practically one should perform all worldly duties  required  to  maintain\nbodily subsistence and then to please the Supreme  Lord  one  should  adhere\nthe ordinances of the Vedic scriptures fulfilling both daily and  occasional\nduties as to varnasrama or one's status and position  in  society  according\nto  time  and  circumstances.  Performing  all  these  activities  for   the\nsatisfaction of the Supreme  Lord  one  becomes  essentially  His  dependent\nalthough inspired and activated to perform these  services  by  the  Supreme\nLord within by His feature as Paramatma the supreme soul. Thus one  will  be\never loving engaged in chanting the  names  of  Lord  Krishna,  singing  His\npraises, reciting His glories, rendering services, prostrating  before  Him.\nThou  shalt  realise  that  every  aspect  of  creation,  preservation   and\ndissolution is under His Supreme authority, rule  and  guidance  and  is  in\nfact His appendage.  Meditating  daily  in  full  devotion,  reflecting  and\nmarvelling  over  the  unlimited  multitude  of  phenomenal  qualities   and\nmarvellous attributes such a blessed soul attains the ultimate goal  of  all\nexistence,  eternal  communion  with  the  Supreme  Lord  in  their  eternal\nspiritual form.\n\n",

If such is so then Brahmins and Vaisnavas as well  as\nroyal sages and kings who are devoted to  serving  Lord  Krishna  with  love\nattaining this blessed state need not ever by questioned. The  word  asukham\nmeaning miserable is used to remind one that human  life  is  stricken  with\nthe irrevocable three  fold  afflictions  of  old  age,  disease  and  death\napplicable to everyone. Also everyone is forced to suffer  from  afflictions\nself caused, afflictions from interacting in the world and from  afflictions\nmanifesting from beyond this world. Thus since all humans  are  existing  in\nthis world and are sentient beings endowed by Lord Krishna with an  atma  or\neternal soul to  attain  this  blessed  supreme  destination,  then  without\nquestion all human beings should fully worship and propitiate Lord  Krishna.\n\n\n",

Such a  person  is\nto be esteemed and honoured as  spiritually  enlightened  and  the  best  of\nhuman  beings  equal  to  His  devotees  previously  mentioned.  It  may  be\nquestioned how can  this  be  possible  that  such  a  transgressor  of  the\ninjunctions of his caste can achieve this  position.  It  is  because  their\npresent conduct  and  resolution  are  definitively  focused  in  the  right\nconclusion of unwavering bhakti or loving  devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord.\nSuch a fixed state of  mind  consists  of  the  implicit  understanding  not\navailable to everyone that Lord Krishna solely is  cause  of  all  creation,\nthat Lord Krishna alone is the  source  of  infinite  universes,  that  Lord\nKrishna Himself  is  the  ultimate  controller  of  everything  movable  and\nstationary. That Lord Krishna is the Supreme Lord of  all  and  is  also  my\nteacher, my friend, my sole object of supreme  delight.  A  person  thinking\nlike this is always situated in righteousness. Such a person  is  always  to\nbe honoured and should not be disregarded due to any dereliction of duty  or\ndeviation from the dictates of his caste. To the contrary  because  all  his\nattention and energies are  focused  in  propitiation  and  worship  of  the\nSupreme Lord such a person is to be even more respected  and  honoured.  But\nif there is  still  any  objections  that  by  transgressing  the  customary\ninjunctions  and  ordinances  of  one's  caste  must  cause  obstacles   and\nimpediments for developing atma  tattva  or  realisation  of  the  soul  and\ntaking one further away from  the  Supreme  Lord  as  stated  in  the  Vedic\nscriptures that such a person shall not attain  the  Supreme  Lord  if  they\nhave not ceased from unrighteousness, who is not free  from  passion,  whose\nmind is not under control and  whose  senses  are  unbridled  even  if  such\npersons possess knowledge of the brahman or spiritual  substratum  pervading\nall existence.\n\n",

In this way conformable to the actions of all  created\nbeings does creation  revolve.  The  Vedic  scriptures  state:  The  Supreme\nLord's unequalled sovereign mastery, His infallible will and His  unexcelled\ndominion over all  as  well  as  being  ever  free  of  reproach  for  being\nunmerciful.

It is by a mere fiat of the Supreme  Lord\nKrishna's will  alone  that  the  complete  cosmic  manifestaion  and  total\nmaterial creation full of unlimited moving  and  non-moving  beings  are  in\nexistence and this is what has been revealed as absolute. In the next  verse\nwill be revealed that the origin, creation and dissolution of all beings  is\nlikewise produced by a fiat of His will as well.\n\n",
  "9-2": "\n\n\n\n\nThe words raja-vidya mean kingly knowledge, supreme wisdom. As the  king  is\nthe most supreme ruler this knowledge is the most supreme wisdom. The  words\nraja-guhyam mean the supreme secret or most  confidential.  True  kings  are\nthose who possess lofty minds and deep hearts. So this supreme knowledge  is\nappropriate for those  also  having  such  minds  and  hearts.  Only  people\npossessing lofty minds and deep hearts possess the  discrimination  to  know\nwhat must be kept sacred and  confidential  from  the  mundane  and  profane\nview. To such persons this knowledge is a sacred mystery  and  revered.  The\nword pavitram means pure, sanctifying, having  the  virtue  to  absolve  all\nimpurities which obstruct the attainment of the Supreme  Lord  Krishna.  The\nword pratyasavagamam means realisation by  direct  perception.  Avagamam  is\nthat which is realised and therefore an  object  of  perception.  Hence  the\nreality which  becomes  perceived  is  in  fact  consciousness  and  becomes\npratyasavagamam.\n\nThe purport of this is that by performing bhakti or pure, loving  devotional\nservice unto the Supreme Lord, He immediately reveals Himself internally  to\nHis surrendered devotee. The word  dharmyam  meaning  eternal  righteousness\nhas the virtueof being  inseparable from the Supreme Lord. The attribute  of\ndharmyam is known to be the means to achieve spiritual  communion  with  the\nSupreme Lord.\n\nIn and of itself the very nature  of  virtue  is  happiness.  But  when  the\npractice of virtue is known to be capable of granting direct access  to  the\nSupreme  Lord  it  becomes  extremely  exhilarating  and  is  so  joyful  to\ncultivate as it leads one to the exquisitely blissful goal of attaining  the\nSupreme Lord Krishna. Thus it is susukham kartum or very joyful to  perform.\nThis supreme wisdom being so delightful and congenial is what  Lord  Krishna\nis about to reveal and must always be embraced with faith in  gratitude  and\nlove. The word avyayam means imperishable. This means that bhakti  or  pure,\nloving devotion does not  cease  when  one  attains  the  Supreme  Lord  but\ncontinues expanding, unabated eternally.\n\nWhat Lord Krishna is declaring is that  when  His  loving  devotee  achieves\nthis quality of devotion  then  He  immediately  delivers  Himself  to  them\nentirely, feeling that it  is  insufficient   compensation  by  what  He  is\ngiving to His bhakta or devotee who has so much love for Him.  Lord  Krishna\nfeels that even after He has given Himself  entirely  to  His  devotee  that\nstill this is not enough compensation to  reciprocate  for  their  love  for\nHim. This is how inconceivably profoundly Lord Krishna regards  His  beloved\ndevotees.\n\n\n\n",

Such  thinking  causes\nthem to become: moghasa of vain appetites having desires  that  will  remain\nunfulfilled, mogha-karmano pursuing vain endeavours, mogha-jnana  possessing\nvain knowledge  that  has  no  value  inasmuch  as  it  is  based  on  false\nconceptions of Lord Krishna  on  the  fundamental  level  and  vicetasah  or\nmentally fractured and confused about the Supreme  Lord.  By  accepting  the\nSupreme Lord of all to resemble and  be  equated  with  any  other  ordinary\nhuman, by such mentality whatever effort  and  endeavour  is  embarked  upon\nwith any goal in view shall all be done in vain for such actions  will  reap\nno fruition.\n\n\n",

The Mundaka Upanisad III.II.I  beginning\nsa vedaitat paramam  dhama  states:  Param  dhama  equals  param  jyotih  or\nsupernal transcendental divine light. The  Chandogya  Upanisad  III.XIII.VII\nbeginning atha yad atah paro divo, jyotir  dipyate  states:  Now  above  all\nthat is perceived the supernal transcendental  divine  light  shines  forth.\nThe Chandogya Upanisad VIII:III.IV beginning param jyotir upasampadya  svena\nrupena states: Reaching unto the supernal, transcendental, divine light  one\nresurrects themselves into their own essential spiritual  nature.

The\nChandogya  Upanisad  IV.XIV.III  beginning   yatha   pushkara   palasa   apo\nnaslishyanta evam states: As water is not able to wet the lotus  leaf,  evil\nis not able to influence one who has realised  the  Supreme.  The  Chandogya\nUpanisad V.XXIV.III beginning tad yatheshika-tulam agnau states: As the  tip\nof a reed cast into a fire is at once burnt to  ashes,  so  indeed  are  the\nsins of one who has realised the Supreme Being become consumed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the mahatmanas or great, liberated sages such as Narada  and  Vyasa  who\npossess enlightened cognition of truths both eternal and temporary,  declare\nthat Lord Krishna  is  the  Eternal,  Omniscient,  Omnipotent,  Omnipresent,\nSupreme Absolute Truth and Ultimate Attainment. Wherever  the  Supreme  Lord\nKrishna has been  present  that  world  becomes  highly  blest  and  accrues\neternal benedictions forever. Those who are knowledgeable about the  meaning\nof the Vedic scriptures and who have realised the ultimate spiritual  truths\ndeclare Lord Krishna to be the Supreme Absolute Truth.

And  His  vibhuti  is  all  of  the\nseven feminine perfections being  kirtih  or  exalted  reputation,  srir  or\nlustrous beauty, vak or  articulate  speech,  smrtih  or  excellent  memory,\nmedha  or  discerning  intelligence,  dhrtih  or  fortitude  and  kasma   or\nforgiveness.\n\n",
  "10-3": "\n\n\n\n\nOne who is never born is ajam or without birth. This attribute connotes  the\nSupreme Lord Krishna as contra-distinguished from the transitory  insentient\nmatter and the sentient beings bound by samsara or the  perpetual  cycle  of\nbirth and death. The term anadim meaning  without  beginning  differentiates\nthe Supreme Lord from the  muktas  or  liberated  beings  in  the  spiritual\nworlds who although having become birthless did  have  a  beginning  at  the\ntime of their liberation. The nature of liberation implies being freed  from\nbondage  at  some  time  and  is  thus  characterised  by  previously  being\nassociated with the material  manifestation  and  duality.  Hence  the  term\nanandi denotess that the Supreme Lord never had contact or association  with\nduality and materialism due  to  the  fact  that  He  is  transcendental  to\nduality and everything material, The Svetasvatara Upanisad VI.XIX  beginning\nniravadyam meaning  the  Supreme  Lord  is  perfection,  confirms  this.  it\nsometime had to be freed from a  state  of  bondage.  Thus  the  spiritually\nintelligent among mortals are those who realise that  the  Lord  Krishna  is\nthe Supreme Lord over all other gods and lords  being  completely  different\nfrom them in essence and in  substance.  The  spiritually  intelligent  also\nrealise that Lord Krishna  is  the  antithesis  and  eternally  contrary  to\nanything associated with  evil  and  unrighteousness.  The  word  asammudhah\nmeans those who are not  deluded,  alluding  to  the  spiritual  intelligent\nwhich comprises being free from  the  illusion  of  perceiving  anything  as\nequal to the Supreme Lord, being free from the illusion  of  believing  that\nanything is separate from the Supreme Lord and being free from the  illusion\nof not identifying oneself as being an  eternal,  infinitesimal  portion  of\nthe Supreme Lord. Thus one who is asammudhah is free from  the  defects  and\nimpediments of karma or reactions to sinful actions which is great  obstacle\nin the development of bhakti or loving devotion to the Supreme Lord.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother angle of vision is that as in the world  the  emperor  although  the\nmost powerful monarch amongst humans, he still is like  all  others  subject\nto old age, disease and death. Yet  he  has  been  awarded  emperor  by  the\nSupreme Lord due to some act of merit. This holds true also  for  Indra  the\nking of all the demigods and even higher with Brahma the  architect  of  the\nmaterial existence, both were also awarded their posts by the  Supreme  Lord\nas a result of great acts of merit.  Although  they  live  for  millions  of\nyears by Earth time calculations for them it is as 100 years and at the  end\nof that time they die also and transmigrate into  another  form  in  another\nexistence. Even  exalted  beings  come  under  the  three-fold  bhavanas  of\nmaterial existence being karma  bhavana  like  Janaka  and  others,  brahman\nbhavana like Sanaka and Sanatana and ubhaya bhavana like Brahma himself  and\nare  subject  to  birth  and  death  according  to  their  acts.  The  Vedic\nscriptures confirms this.  In  Vishnu  Purana  VI.VII.IIL  it  states  that:\nTherefore  they  are  all  accountable  for  their  acts.  The  Svetasvatara\nUpanisad VI.VIII states: Yo  brahmanan  vidadhati  meaning  He  who  creates\nBrahma. This also applies to any mortal who  has  acquired  the  eight  main\nsiddhis or perfections such as anima  or manima etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Supreme Lord is loka-maheshvaram the Supreme Lord of all  beings  in\nall worlds.\n\n\nLoka is the total cosmos being the aggregate total of  all  sentient  and\nnon-sentient categories in  conditions  of  inactive  latency  or  active\npatency. The sentient includes both  muktas or liberated beings  as  well\nas baddhas or not liberated beings. So all  this  is  under  the  Supreme\nLord's control and rule.\n\n1) Maha is greatness and consists of the Supreme Lord being the storehouse\nof unlimited attributes of glorious qualities and His always being the\neternal antithesis of all that is unrighteous, demoniac and evil.\n2) Isvarah means Lord as being the supreme, sovereign ruler eternally,\nindependent of all.\n\nThus the Supreme  Lord  is  completely  unlike  all  others,  singular  unto\nHimself alone, independent and superior to all. One who does not  incur  the\nerror of including the Supreme Lord Krishna amongst all  the  various  other\nlesser gods and who understands Him to be the sole cause,  the  sole  source\nand the sole origin of all creation, verily realises Him and  by  His  grace\nis relieved from all reactions to previous actions.\n\nThus by illustrating how meditation on the factual absolute  nature  of  the\nSupreme Lord removes the obstacles impeding  the  blossoming  of  bhakti  or\nloving devotion  unto  the  Supreme  Lord  causing  such  bhakti  to  become\ninaugurated; Lord Krishna will next explain how bhakti may be  activated  by\ndeep and profound meditation on His sublime transcendental divine  qualities\nand attributes.\n\n",

Lord Krishna exists in all things so  this  means  that  all\nthings are always bonded to Him. It  is  evident  from  this  that  what  is\nintended to be shown by samanadhi-karanya or co-existence of  substance  and\nattribute as one object is the reality of the Supreme Lord  residing  within\nall beings as the purely spiritual eternal soul.

The word mahatma means\ngreat soul, He who is infallible with indomitable will.\n\nThe manifestation of the Supreme Lord Krishna who is the Sovereign Lord of\nall, whose pure spiritual body is saccidananda or eternal existence,\nunlimited cognisance and endless bliss, transcendentally accepts a human\nlooking form to bless all the worlds. The Vishnu PuranaV.III.X beginning\njatosi deva-devasa sankha cakra, gada, dhara states: When Lord Krishna\nappeared as an infant baby in the jail cell of Kamsa in Mathura as the son\nof King Vasudeva and Queen Devaki, He manifested His four armed form with\nconch, discus, mace and flower. At that time King Vasudeva very much afraid\nof Kamsa who had slain his six previous sons at birth prayed to Him thus:\nO' Lord of lords , Thou art God incarnate. Thy form is divine. Be pleased\nO'Lord to conceal and hide this form. In order to quickly alleviate the\nanxiety of His father, Lord Krishna rendered two of the four arms invisible\nalong with the divine weapons. Later when He grew older He went back to\nMathura and slew Kamsa and released Vasudeva and Devaki from prison. At\nthat time His other two arms became visible and He resumed His four-armed\nform again.\n\nThe Mahabharata states: The Supreme Lord, the son of Vasudeva with four-\narms, broad, strong and robust bearing the conch, the cakra, the mace, etc.\nIt was the four-arm form of Lord Krishna that constantly burned in\nSisupala's mind after Lord Krishna at her urgent request usurped Princess\nRukmini from him and married her. As Arjuna was an intimate friend of Lord\nKrishna during all His royal pastimes this is the form Arjuna knew best.\nFinally as a boon to fully console him He displayed His original svakam or\npersonal two-armed form of saumya-vapuh or gentle nature being the same as\nall human beings.\n\n",

This is what is affirmed later in chapter  14,\nverse 2 with the words mama sadharmyam agatah meaning endowed  with  a  form\nsimilar to the Supreme Lords. The Mundaka  Upanisad  III.I,II,III  beginning\nniranjanah paramam samyam  states:  Absolved  from  all  sins  one  achieves\nsublime similarity with the Supreme Lord.

The  understanding  is  that  despite  the\natma or eternal soul being present in the  etheric  heart  of  every  living\nentity everywhere in creation in the demigods, the humans, the animals,  the\nfish,  the  plants  etc.  It  is  completely  inconceivable  how  the  total\naggregate of all these trillions upon trillions of  souls  approaching  even\nan infinite amount actually comprise the transcendental, spiritual  body  of\nthe Supreme Lord Krishna. Not only is it not possible to conceive  this,  it\nis also  impossible to imagine what such an infinite  spiritual  form  would\nappear like so it is completely indescribable. Even if  one  achieved  atma-\ntattva or soul realisation and were able  to  perceive  the  form  of  their\nindividual atma it would not be of any  consequence  in  conceiving  by  any\nstretch of the imagination such an infinite and phenomenal  spiritual  form.\nThe word kutastham means stable  or  uniform  denoting  that  essence  which\nnever changes in form regardless of the constant changing of bodies  of  all\nliving beings every life, thus it is acalam  or  immutable  because  of  its\nsingular unmoving nature and thus dhruvam or everlasting.  Along  with  this\nmust be  sanniyamyendriya-gramam  meaning  all  the  senses  must  be  fully\ncontrolled  and  restrained  from  absorption  in  their  accustomed   sense\nobjects. The phrase sarvatra sama-buddhayah  means  equanimity  towards  all\nliving entities which manifests  itself  when  the  cognition  of  the  atma\nresiding in the etheric heart of all living  entities  being  of  variegated\nand diverse species seen specifically as  consciousness  although  concealed\nby various forms becomes a reality. Firmly fixed in this  understanding  one\nautomatically becomes sarva-bhuta-hite ratah or favourably disposed  to  the\nwelfare of all living entities or it can mean well removed from wishing  any\nenmity towards  any  jiva  or  embodied  being,  for  enmity  is  a  product\nengendered by false ego due to imagining gradations in  the  atma's  between\njivas because of external differences in their physical bodies.\n\n",

The\nequanimity mentioned here is of a more  profound  nature  that  of   keeping\none's equanimity when seeing one in front of them face  to  face.  The  word\naniketah means unattached to home or fixed residence  due  to  being  firmly\nattached to bhakti  or  exclusive  loving  devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord.\nEqually balanced in praise and censure, happiness and misery,  pleasure  and\npain etc. Such a devotee of the Supreme Lord Krishna is very dear to Him.\n\n",
  "12-1": "\nIn the previous chapter the Supreme  Lord  Krishna,  the  possessor  of  all\ndivine attributes as well as countless exalted qualities such  as  an  ocean\nof mercy, compassion, affability, omniscience etc. and  the  source  of  all\navatars or  incarnations  and  expansions,  being  the  ultimate  object  of\nworship to all who aspire  for  the  path  of  bhakti  or  exclusive  loving\ndevotion unto the Supreme Lord Krishna;  revealed  His  unlimited  sovereign\npower of  universal  dominion  in  the  form  of  His  visvarupa  or  divine\nuniversal form after being requested by His  devotee  Arjuna.  It  has  also\nbeen established that uninterrupted profound, sublime bhakti  alone  without\ncessation is the only possible way  to  realise  the  Supreme  Lord  in  His\nultimate nature and experience communion with Him. Now in this  chapter  the\nfollowing three realities will be examined.\n1) The inherent superiority  of  an  aspirant  performing  bhakti  involving\nmeditation  directly  upon  the  Supreme  Lord  Himself  as  compared  to\nmeditation upon the atma or the eternal soul which  only  leads  to  atma\ntattva or realisation of the soul in order to attain the ultimate goal of\nall existence. This  superiority  of  bhakti  is  measured  in  terms  of\nabsolute fulfilment of the ultimate goal and in the sublime felicity  and\nbliss of performance. Bhakti or love  of  God  is  considered  the  fifth\npurusharthas above the other four ambitions of humans beings which are 1.\nDharma or righteousness which consists  of  two  parts  first  being  the\nregular performance of Vedic activities and the second  being  performing\nactions which benefit all living entities such as freely providing  fresh\nwater and salt to all and  protecting  against  all  demoniac  influences\nwhenever they appear. 2. Artha or the  righteous  acquirement  of  wealth\naccording to the Vedic scriptures without usury or deception. 3. Kama  or\nenjoyment and pleasure in the  material  existence  following  the  Vedic\nscriptures without perversion or degradation. 4. Moksa or liberation from\nmaterial existence by atma tattva or liberation from  material  existence\nby bhakti realising the Supreme Lord direct. It should be noted that atma\ntattva is automatically an inherent part of bhakti and thus those blessed\nliving entities who perform bhakti to the Supreme Lord Krishna or any  of\nHis authorised avatars do not have to make any separate or special effort\nto achieve this.\n2) The method of realising the Supreme Lord will be given in verse two.\n3) The aksaram or abstract, impersonal unmanifest path  examined  in  verses\n3,4,5 is applicable  for  those  who  are  inept  and  unqualified.  This\nineptitude and lack of qualification is due  to  the  absence  of  humbly\napproaching a spiritual master from one of the four  authorised  Vaisnava\nsampradaya's or empowerd lines of disciplic succession  and  after  being\naccepted by him and initiated being taught the fundamentals of bhakti.\n\nThe superiority of bhakti or exclusive loving devotion to the  Supreme  Lord\nKrishna is made manifest by the superiority of He, Himself being the  object\nof such loving devotion. This maxim of superiority  was  briefly  stated  by\nLord Krishna in chapter six verse 47 where  He  states  :  Those  with  firm\nfaith in the Vedic scriptures describing  super-excellent  devotion  to  Him\nand with hearts  full  of  love  dedicate  all  their  actions  to  Him  are\nyuktatamah the most superior of all.\n\nThe words satata-yuktah meaning always engaged denotes ever  devout  towards\nthe  Supreme  Lord  being  ever  intent  on  communion  with  Him  which  is\ncontinuing the sentiments of the last verse in chapter 11.  The  words  tvam\nparyupasate means direct worship of Lord Krishna and refers to  deeming  the\nSupreme Lord as the complete fulfilment of one's every ambition and  desire.\nThe Supreme Lord, the perfect, infallible one, the  Sovereign  Lord  of  all\ncreation  and  the  refuge  of  all  cosmic  glories,  possessing  unlimited\nattributes of exalted qualities such as divinity,  omniscience,  compassion,\nomnipotence, etc.  Such  ones  are  thy  eternal  adorers  and  always  your\nbeloved.\n\nThose other votaries  are  the  worshippers  of  the  abstract,  impersonal,\navyaktam or unmanifest and imperceptible. which is aksaram or  imperishable.\nSuch also reflect and contemplate upon the  nature  of  the  pratyagatma  or\nindividual soul which is imperishable also as well as  being  unmanifest  in\nas much as it is indiscernible by the mind and imperceptible to any  of  the\nsenses such as the eye or ear, etc.\n\nOf these two classes of aspirants which one is superior  and  most  suitable\nfor  performing  yoga  or  the  science  of  the  individual   consciousness\nattaining communion with the ultimate  consciousness.  Inferring  which  one\nwould achieve their respective  goals most expediently. In verse seven  Lord\nKrishna gives the definitive reply in answer to  this  query  by  succinctly\nrevealing the most expeditious way to attain the ultimate goal.\n\n",
  "12-5": "\nActions are of two types. One is worldly activities undertaken  to  maintain\nand progress the material existence of the physical body such  as  obtaining\nfood  and  shelter  and  material  development.  The  other   is   spiritual\nactivities enjoined by the injunctions  of  the  Vedic  scriptures  such  as\npropitiation to the Supreme Lord, absence of violence to any  living  being,\ncharity, etc. in short every act without an ulterior motive  and  without  a\nhopeful gain. Whosoever being spiritual minded  without  any  motive  except\nfor satisfying the Supreme Lord Krishna and without any  desire  of  seeking\nanything in return from Him, who offer all their activities as  devotion  to\nHim, keeping Him alone as their sole goal and in one-pointed devotion  focus\ntheir meditation on Him fully while worshipping Him in all their  activities\nsuch as chanting His holy names, glorifying Him, offering  prayers  to  Him,\nprostrating before His  deity  form,  hearing  about  His  lilas  or  divine\npastimes, enlightening others about His glories, etc. as the be all and  end\nall of all existence itself. To such devotees as these  who  always  are  in\ncommunion  with  Lord  Krishna  in  their  hearts  and  minds,  He   Himself\npersonally becomes their saviour by being  their  samuddharta  or  deliverer\nfrom mrtyu-samsara-sagarat or the deadly ocean of  the  perpetual  cycle  of\nbirth and death which is the principle barrier which  stops  the  atma's  or\neternal souls of all jivas or embodied from attaining Him when  the  end  of\neach physical life has transpired.\n\n",

Nirmamah  means\ndevoid  of  sentiments  of   possessiveness   and   ego   related\nconceptions mine-ness regarding the  physical  body,  family  and\nassociated relationships and  objects.  Nirahankarah  means  free\nfrom the false conception  of  thinking  one's  self  to  be  the\nphysical body and consequently unaffected  by  the  dualities  of\nmaterial  existence  such  as  pain  and  pleasure,  praise   and\nridicule, joy and grief, etc. all based upon the mentality of the\nmind.

Drdha-niscayah means firmly resolved in  the  knowledge\nof the Vedic scriptures regarding the immortality of the atma  or\neternal soul and the Supreme Lord and irrevocably established  in\nbhakti  to  the  Lord  Krishna.  Arpita-mano-buddhir  means   who\ndedicates their intelligence and  consciousness  to  the  Supreme\nLord by performing activities dedicated to Him without desire for\nrecompense.

The mind\nhowever great it may be has no qualification  or  eligibility  to\naccess the atma. Thus it would behove an aspirant to  pursue  the\nnext alternative and  attempt to  develop  atma  tattva  or  soul\nrealisation as instructed by Lord Krishna in verses III. IV and V\nof this chapter. If after prolonged practice and attempts if atna\ntattva does not arise  because  of  a  lack  of  inner  spiritual\ndevelopment or due to  an  unstable  mind  easily  distracted  or\nbecause of weakness in controlling the  senses  then  one  should\nadopt themselves to the contemplation and reflection of the  atma\nas delineated in chapter two as the  next  alternative.  If  even\nthis is to difficult to execute with regularity then  one  should\nperform activities that please the Supreme Lord and renounce  the\ndesire for rewards for it.

Performing activities in this way without\nany interest in receiving rewards and benefits will result in the\nabsence of all reactions and thus  the  cessation  of  all  sins.\nThereafter one will achieve peace of  mind  and  from  there  one\nbecomes a candidate for practising contemplation of the atma.  In\nconclusion aspirants who  are  inept  at  performing  bhakti  are\nencouraged to perform simpler methods which  will  step  by  step\ngradually bring one up to that platform.

In verse LXX beginning karma vasya guna we find: Verily O  king  the\nthree gunas of sattva or goodness, rajas or passion and tamas  or  ignorance\nare dependent solely upon karma or reactions to one's own actions which  are\nall the consequence of avidya or the absence of knowledge which is  part  of\nall creatures at birth. Yet in verse LXXI  beginning  atma  suddho  we  find\nrevealed:  That  the  immortal  soul  is  purely  spiritual,   imperishable,\nsublime,  devoid  of  material  qualities  and  distinctly  different   from\nprakriti or the material substratum pervading all physical existence.\n\nSimilarly the Visnu Purana II.XIII.IXC  beginning  pindah  prithag  meaning:\nThe physical body characterised by face, head, hands and body  is  different\nfrom the embodied being then to which of these can one refer to as I or  me.\nAgain in II.XII.CII beginning kim tvam etat chirah meaning:   Art  thou  thy\nhead, or thy chest, or thy stomach or thy foot and the like O  king  or  are\nthou thine?  And  in  II:XII.CIII  beginning  samast  avayavebhyam  meaning:\nDistinct art thou O  king  from  all  thy  bodily  parts  and  being  clever\ndetermine who is the I.\nBoth these examples postulate that matter the physical body and  the  spirit\nsoul are distinctly different from each other. Vasudeva meaning the  Supreme\nLord Krishna is eulogised in  innumerable  Vedic  scriptures  In  the  Visnu\nSahasra verse CXXXVII beginning  indiyani  mano  meaning:  The  senses,  the\nmanas, buddhi,  ego,  health,  strength  and  spirit  are  all  ensouled  by\nVasudeva, both the ksetra and ksetrajna.\n\nDistinctly by various mantras of the Rig Veda, Yajur  Veda,  Sama  Veda  and\nAtharva Veda the distinctions between the bodily nature  and  the  spiritual\nsoul nature are sublimely sung.\nAn example is found in the Tattiriya Upanisad II.I.II beginning  tasmad  eva\netasmadatmana akasah sambhutah  meaning:  From  the  atma  or  eternal  soul\nverily akasa or space has manifested ,  from  space  ether  has  manifested,\nfrom ether has come air, from air has come fire, from fire has  come  water,\nfrom water has come earth, from earth has come plants, from plants has  come\nfood, from food comes all embodied species  headed  by  the  human  species.\nThus the nature of the physical body has been stated.  As  well  the  subtle\nprinciple of pranas or life airs and the even subtler principle of manas  or\nthe mind and intellect  have  been  stated  in  conclusion.  More  than  the\nprinciple of the manas is the supra-subtle principle of the vijnana-maya  or\nthe conscious soul and the source of all of the above is  the  Supreme  Lord\nin His localised form as paramatma the  Supreme  Soul  within  all  sentient\nbeings and even more supra-subtle than even this is His transcendental  body\nas the composite form of all atmas in all living entities known  as  ananda-\nmaya as given in the Tattiriya Upanisad  II.V.II  beginning:  tasyaisha  eva\nsharira atma which is the witness and monitor of living entities.  \n\nCategorically as well the distinct characteristics by which the  ksetra  and\nksetrajna  exist  and  their  manifestation  by  the  brahman  or  spiritual\nsubstratum pervading all existence is revealed in many  places  in  the  Rig\nVeda and the Atharva Veda.\n\nAlso the Vedanta Sutra verses reveal in its sublimely concise aphorisms  the\nnature of the brahman and its relationship with  the  Supreme  Lord.  It  is\nalso called the Sariraka Sutras  because  of  its  conclusive  authoritative\njudgement on these  esoteric topics.  For example in Vedanta Sutra  II.III.I\nbeginning no viyadasruteh meaning: The akasha or space  is  eternal  because\nthere is  no  Vedic  evidence  contrary  to  this  and  thus  all  decisions\nregarding the nature of the ksetra are formulated also in this way.  Another\nexample is seen in II.III.XVIII beginning utcrantigatyagatinam meaning:  The\njiva or embodied soul is infinitesimal because the  Vedic  scriptures  state\nthat it goes out of an old body and returns to  a  new  body.  The  atma  or\neternal soul is  superlatively  conscious  and  such  a  reality  formulates\ndecisions regarding  the  ksetrajna.  But  in  verse  II.III.XXXX  beginning\nkritaprayatnapekshastu vihita pratisiddha meaning: The Supreme  Lord  impels\nall jivas to act in accordance with the nature and  tendency  of  their  own\nself  enacted  previous  actions  and  effects.   Everything  is  under  the\ncomplete control and total dominion of the Supreme  Lord  but  He  does  not\ninterfere with the freewill  of  the  jiva  although  He  is  certainly  the\nsupreme  soul  of  living  entities.  So  the   evidence   of   the   ksetra\nand ksetrajna have been copiously expounded in various Vedic  scriptures  in\nnumerous ways but now Lord Krishna will describe the same  in  a  lucid  and\nconcise manner.\n\n",
  "13-22": "\n\n\n\n\nLord  Krishna  confirms  with  the  words  pasyati  meaning   perceives   or\ndiscriminates that one who realises  that  paramatma  or  the  Supreme  Soul\nexisting equally within all jivas or embodied beings  is  the  ksetrajna  or\nknower of the sphere of activity and that  it  is  distinctly  distinguished\nfrom prakriti the material substratum  pervading  physical  existence  which\nmanifests as unlimited forms such as demigod, human, animal, etc.  In  other\nwords  recognising  the  Supreme  Lord  as  the  same  omnipresent   eternal\nconsciousness localised within each and every living  entity  and  realising\nthat it is singular. Also distinguishing the fact that  while  all  physical\nbodies decay and perish; the atma or individual immortal soul does not  ever\ndecay or perish because it has an eternal, transcendental  nature.  This  is\nconfirmed  in  the  Vishnu   Purana:   VI.VII.LVIII   beginning   pradhanadi\nviseshantam meaning: the undecaying within the decaying.  One who  correctly\ncomprehends the atma in this manner properly perceives reality. But one  who\nthinks that the  atma  is  subject  to  birth  and  death  and  that  it  is\nmodifiable and variable like the forms of living entities which  are  always\nchanging; then such a person will always remained  confined  in  samsara  or\nthe perpetual cycle of birth and death in material existence.\n\n\n",
  "13-26": "\n\n\n\n\nSo now the eternal, omniscient and all pervading nature of paramatma or  the\nSupreme Soul is being revealed by Lord Krishna  as  being  totally  distinct\nfrom the physical body of the jiva  or  embodied  being.  Although  residing\nwithin the exhaustible physical  body  which  is  perishable,  paramatma  is\ninexhaustible and imperishable due to it being anaditivat of eternality.  It\nis infinite  in  time  and  infinite  beyond  time.  It  is  nirgunatvat  or\npossessing no material qualities or  attributes  and  neither  performs  any\nactions nor is affected or implicated  by  any  actions  the  physical  body\nperforms. Next it will  be  explained  how  the  paramatma  although  having\nconstant association within the physical body is not degraded by any of  the\nbodily properties.\n\n\n",
  "13-14": "\n\n\n\n\nHere Lord Krishna explains that from the beginning of  time  purusa  or  the\nimmortal soul  and  prakriti  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical\nexistence have been  existing  united  together.  The  word  vikarams  means\nmodifications  and  transformations  this  denotes  non-spiritual   material\nattributes and passions. The word gunas or three modes  of  material  nature\nbeing sattva or goodness  with  its  virtues,  rajas  or  passion  with  its\ndesires and tamas or nescience with its ignorance are  all  by  products  of\nprakriti. Virtuous qualities such as reverence and humility are situated  in\nsattva and effectuate moksa  or  liberation  from  material  existence.  The\nqualities of passion with their desires  and  attachments  are  situated  in\nrajas and effectuates  bondage  to  material  existence.  The  qualities  of\nignorance with sense gratification as the goal of existence is  situated  in\ntamas and effectuates degeneration into  less  evolved  species  next  life.\nPurusa uniting with prakriti has been perpetuating since  the  beginning  of\ntime and expresses itself as a ksetra  or  field  of  activity  which  is  a\nphysical body. The jiva or embodied being influenced  by  the  modifications\nof rajas and tamas in the form of  desire  and  attachment,  attraction  and\naversion, shrouds the atma  or  immortal  soul  and  keeps  it  in  bondage.\nContrarily the jiva being influenced by the modifications of sattva  in  the\nform of the 20 super excellent attributes of spiritual  endowment  given  in\nverses 8 to 12 headed by reverence and humility  constitutes  the  cause  of\nthe atma attaining moksa.\n\n\n",
  "13-17": "\nThe purusah or the manifestation of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  transcends\nboth the body and the mind dwelling within all sentient beings as  paramatma\nthe Supreme Soul and is upadrasta or the impartial witness who by  means  of\nthe will  directs  the  operations  pertaining  to  the  physical  body  and\nanumanta or sanctions the activities performed  by  all  jivas  or  embodied\nbeings that lead to  joy  and  grief  in  pursuing  activities  in  material\nexistence. Thus by virtue of ruling, supporting and guiding  the  jivas  the\npurusah is the Mahesvarah the Supreme controller of the physical  body,  the\nsenses and the mind of all jivas. The conjunctive particle api meaning  also\nrefers to the epithet of great lord which denotes that as far  as  the  body\nis concerned it applies to paramatma  as  well.  The  phrase  purusah  parah\nmeans that the Supreme Being  as  paramatma  is  to  be  differentiated  and\nseparate due to its unlimited omnipresence within all jivas, from  the  atma\nor individual soul which is localised within each jiva.  Although  both  are\nimmortal and possess the omniscient propensities of infinite cognizance  and\ndivine consciousness.\n\n",
  "13-11": "\n\n\n\n\nBy the Supreme Lord Krishna who is known as Parabrahma intrinsic potency  as\nthe source of the brahman or spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence\nit is devoid of all  divisions  abiding  everywhere  within  all  creatures,\ndemigods, humans etc. But to the spiritually unaware  there  appears  to  be\ndivisions and differences due to variegation of  forms.  What  Lord  Krishna\nhas stated in verse two of this chapter that those who are knowledgeable  of\nthe ksetra-jna are spiritually enlightened about the atma or  immortal  soul\nexisting equally within all living entities  distinctly  separate  from  the\nphysical body although resideing within the etheric heart  of  all  sentient\nbeings. When textural quotes are read as I am a demigod, I am  a  man,  etc.\nit is only referring to the body, the physical form shrouding the  atma  due\nto karma the resultant reactions from past life  activities.  To  comprehend\nthe atma as a  distinct,  separate  immortal  entity  can  be  discerned  by\nreflection and contemplation inasmuch as the atma provides the  support  for\nthe aggregate combination of the five fundamental elements of earth,  water,\nfire, air and ether which in varying degrees make up the physical  body.  So\nParabrahma is  known  as  bhuta-bhartr  the  maintainer  of  all  beings  as\ndistinguished from the maintained. Since Parabrahma exists  after  the  time\nof universal destruction He is known as  grasisnu  the  annihilator  of  the\nmaterial  elements  as  distinguished   from   the   annihilated.    Because\nParabrahma is the causer of transformations He is known as prabha-visnu  the\ncreator of  universal  manifestation  as  distinguished  from  the  created.\nInasmuch as no such properties are ever present in a dead  body  it  can  be\ncorrectly concluded that mere matter possessed ksetra or field  of  activity\nis never capable of being the maintainer, the  annihilator  or  the  creator\nwhereas the ksetra-jna is capable.\n\n\n",
  "13-12": "\n\n\n\n\nLights are those found in the sun, the stars, fire, gems, etc. The light  of\nthese lights denotes that which illuminates all these or that by which  they\nare perceived denoting the light of consciousness by  which  all  luminaries\nsuch as the sun and the stars are seen to shine. As for  human  made  lights\nsuch as  lamps,  torches  and  the  rest,  they  only  dispel  the  darkness\nintervening  between  the  sense  of  sight  and  its   object   and   their\nilluminating power is limited to the sense perception of  sight.  But  there\nis no limitation with the light and sight of  the  atma  once  it  has  been\nrealised. The words tamasah param means beyond  darkness  referring  to  the\ndarkness  of  tamas  or  ignorance  designating  the  subtle   but   limited\nconditions  of  prakriti  or  the  material  substratum  pervading  physical\nexistence; but the atma or immortal soul being eternal is transcendental  to\nany conditions or limitations.  The  words  jnanam  jneyam  means  knowledge\nworthy of being known comprehensible by the intellect and  characterised  by\nconsciousness. The words jnana  gamyam    means  wisdom  accessible  through\nknowledge or that wisdom gained from embodying and  living  the  20  virtues\ngiven in verses 8 through 12 beginning with amanitvam  or  reverence.  These\nexalted virtues which  constitute  spiritual  knowledge  are  the  means  to\nachieve the wisdom of the atma. As the atma is situated within the heart  of\nall sentient beings, the Supreme Lord Krishna known as  Parabrahma  is  hrdi\nsarvasy dhisthitam situated in the heart of all sentient beings.\n\n\n",
  "13-13": "\nPreviously a concise description of what is to be known as constituting  the\nksetra or field of activity has been given  by  Lord  Krishna  beginning  in\nverse six with maha-bhutani    meaning  the  five  fundamental  elements  of\nmaterial nature and in verses 8 through  12  beginning  with  amanivitam  or\nreverence the 20 excellent are enumerated as the  means  for  acquiring  the\nknowledge of atma-tattva  or  soul  realisation  up  to  perception  of  the\neternal spiritual reality,  knowing  the  Supreme  Lord  reside  within  the\netheric heart of all living beings. Here  Lord  Krishna  states  mad  bhakta\nmeaning His devotees are knowledgeable of the reality regarding the  ksetra,\nknowledgeable of the means by which to realise the  atma  or  immortal  soul\nwhich is of the nature of ksetra-jna or knower of  the  sphere  of  activity\nand distinctly different from  the  ksetra.  Only  His  devotees  are  those\nsituated in such knowledge and mad  bhavayopapadyate  meaning  qualified  to\nattain exclusive loving devotion to Him which  is  everlasting  and  eternal\nand which is different from samsara or the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and\ndeath. Next Lord Krishna will explain the  beginingless  state  of  the  two\ndistinct natural verities of matter and  soul  conjoined  together  and  the\ndifferent functions each is engendered to perform as well as how  these  two\nverities came to be situated in this condition.\n\n",
  "13-25": "\n\nLord Krishna is stating that one must realizes that  all  the  diversity  of\nforms throughout creation is manifested by the medium  of  prakriti  or  the\nmaterial  substratum  pervading  physical  existence  which  gives  rise  to\nunlimited bodies and their correlating senses. All jivas or embodied  beings\nwhether demigods, humans or animals are constituted of the dual  natures  of\npurusa the supreme spirit and prakriti. The compound word eka-stham  meaning\nsituated in one refers to the singularity of prakriti which  the  ksetra  or\nsphere of activity  exists  within.  The  word  vistaram  meaning  expansion\nrefers to the variegated myriads of differentiated existences in  successive\nform manifestations such as  children,  grandchildren,  great  grandchildren\nall uniquely emanating  from  the  same  principle  of  prakriti.  Whosoever\nunderstands that all external appearing differences  have  their  origin  in\nprakriti and not in purusa or the supreme spirit nor paramatma  the  supreme\nsoul; such a person attains the realization  of  the  brahman  or  spiritual\nsubstratum pervading all existence.\n\n",
  "13-10": "\n\n\n\nThe word bahih means outside, this refers  to  the  atma  or  immortal  soul\nwhich still exists even when  it  departs  a  physical  body  at  death  and\nabandons the subtle body along with  the  five  elements  of  earth,  water,\nfire, air and ether  although  it  is  present  within  them  as  well.   As\nconfirmed  in  the  Chandogya  Upanisad  VI.VII.VII  beginning  sa  ya  esho\nanimaitad  means:  The  source  of  the  brahman  or  spiritual   substratum\npervading all existence is  Parabrahma  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  who  is\neternally existing in everything by His transcendental  potency.  By  nature\nit is acaram or stationary and unmoving but it is caram  or  moving  in  its\nembodied  state.  Due  to  being  supra-subtle  without  material,   mundane\nqualities it is avijneyam or incomprehensible. The  atma  or  immortal  soul\npossesses all powers and knowledge  although  it  occupies  and  inhabits  a\nbodily  form.  Because  it  is  subatomic  it  can  not  be   perceived   by\ntechnological methods and remains  a  mystery.  Therefore  it  is  extremely\ndifficult for worldly people of logic and  reason  to  understand  it  being\nseparate and distinct from the physical body. The  words  durastham  cantike\nca tat means that the atma although present within their own bodies is  very\nfar away from those who are arrogant, ostentatious, irreverent, etc. who  do\nnot possesses the 20 virtues of righteousness given in verses 8 to  12  such\nas humility, reverence and nonviolence. But contrarily it is extremely  near\nto those dear ones who possess the 20 virtues.  This  is  because  these  20\nvirtues facilitate a living entities  ability  to  perceive  internally  and\nrealize the atma. \n\n",
  "13-23": "\n\nThe Supreme Lord Krishna is  known  as  isvara  is  residing  saman  equally\nsarvatra within all beings. This includes demigods,  humans,  animals,  etc.\nThe word pasyati here meaning perceives denotes that the  atma  or  immortal\nsoul is recognised wherever it may abide. By thus comprehending  the  actual\nnature of the atma one  never  degrades  themselves  and  na  hinasti  never\ncauses harm to oneself. Contrarily if one insists on  identifying  the  atma\nin the same way as  the  physical  body  in  the  differentiating  light  of\nunlimited bodily forms one injures and degrades  their  eternal  self.  This\nunderstanding saves one from acquiring karma or reactions to  actions  which\nis the main cause of confinement to samsara or the perpetual cycle of  birth\nand death. By gaining this basic realisation one achieves the goal of  atma-\ntattva or soul realisation and then becomes eligible  for  param  gatim  the\nsupreme destination and highest attainment.\n\n",
  "13-20": "\n\n\n\n\nContinuing further with  this  theme  Lord  Krishna  reiterates  that  still\nothers who are incompetent to follow the paths of yoga  or  the  science  of\nthe  individual  consciousness  attaining  communion   with   the   ultimate\nconsciousness which lead to atma tattva or realisation  of  the  soul.  They\nmust hear from the Vaisnavas the devotees of the  Supreme  Lord  and  follow\nthe teachings of the sages and  munis  who  are  established  in  truth  and\nrighteousness. Then they can begin to traverse the path  of  karma  yoga  or\ndevotional activities and then onto  jnana  yoga  the  perfecting  of  Vedic\nknowledge, etc. and commence actual contemplation of the  atma  or  immortal\nsoul. Also those who cannot even do that but are able to have faith in  what\nthey learn from superiors, they get purged of their sins  and  absolved  can\ngradually embark upon the path of karma yoga  and  thus  eventually  surpass\nsamsara the perpetual cycle of birth and death. The  word  api  denotes  the\nlevels of competency that different gradations of human beings posess.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext in order to discriminately comprehend the exact position  of  the  atma\nresiding within the jiva  or  embodied  being  perpetually  within  material\nexistence it  is  emphasised  that  whatever  comes  into  existence  either\nmovable or immovable is the product of the union of  the  sentient  and  the\ninsentient known as chit and achit.\n\n\n",
  "13-18": "\n\nThe word evam means in this way refers to the manner  previously  described.\nOne  must  intelligently  comprehends  the  nature   of   the   purusah   or\nmanifeatation  of  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  and  prakriti  the  material\nsubstratum pervading physical existence and understand the three  components\nof prakriti known as the gunas which are the modes of goodness, passion  and\nignorance which are inclusive of  everything  in  material  existence.  They\nwill be fully elaborated on in the next chapter. The word sarvatha means  in\nany way or  condition  and  refers  to  whatever  physical  body  one  finds\nthemselves forced to accept whether demigod, human, demon, etc  due  to  the\ndictate of karma or reactions to  actions.  Na  sa  bhuya  abhijayate  means\nnever takes birth again, never coerced to enter a womb again,  never  forced\nto take a material form again. This means that  at  the  time  the  physical\nbody ceases to exist the atma or immortal  soul  will  be  realized  as  the\neternal essence of the jiva or embodied being and moksa or  liberation  from\nmaterial existence  will  be  achieved  promoting  one  to  the  everlasting\nspiritual worlds never again subject to birth and death.\n\n\n",

One  perceives  that\ntamas or ignorance in the shape of karma or  reactions  to  actions  is  the\nreason for forced confinement in  the  material  existence,  the  terms  and\nconditions of the confinement and the experiences of pleasure  and  pain  in\ncorrelation with the duration of the confinement. One  who  comprehends  all\nthese truly perceives reality.\n\n",
  "13-8": "\nLord Krishna begins this verse with  sarvatah  pani-padam  tat  meaning  the\nSupreme Lords has hands and  feet  everywhere.  This  denotes  that  by  His\npotency the Supreme Lord is capable of doing everywhere what all  hands  and\nfeet do in the embodied state. Similarly  He speaks sarvatah  srutimal  loke\nmeaning He hears everything in all  directions  internally  and  externally.\nThis denotes that He is capable of performing the functions  of  the  senses\nsuch as hearing and seeing without the need of  any  physical  sense  organ.\nThe Supreme Lord known as Parabrahman  although  possessing  not  hands  and\nfeet is able to perform the activities of hands and feet.  The  Svetasvatara\nUpanisad III.IXX beginning apani pado jivana grihita meaning:  Footless  and\nhandless He moves and grasps; eyeless and earless He sees  and  hears.  That\nthe atma or immortal soul of  every  sentient  being  even  situated  as  an\ninfinitesimal particle of Parabrahman also has the  capacity  of  performing\nfunctions without organs as well. This is confirmed in the Mundaka  Upanisad\nIII.I.VIII beginning tatha vidva punya-pape vidhuya niranjana  param  samyam\nupaiti means: The atma casting off the dross of merit  and  demerit  becomes\npurified attaining qualitative sameness in transcendence as the brahman.  So\nin conclusion the ksetra-jna abides  throughout  all  creation  encompassing\neverything. This means  that  the  atma  pervades  all  things  in  creation\nwithout exception for the atma has no limitations of  time  and  space.

Others who are novice in yoga develop their minds  by  jnana  or\nVedic knowledge and sankhyena or subtle discrimination  between  spirit  and\nmatter and applying it diligently soon perceive the  atma  as  well.   Still\nothers who are unfit for the regiment of  jnana yoga and those who  are  fit\nbut prefer an easier method and those whose duty it is  to  set  an  example\nfor the common man; they all follow the path of karma yoga or  the  path  of\nactions devoted to the Supreme Lord that embody devotion and training  their\nminds to control the  senses  become  established  in  yoga  and  eventually\nperceive the atma also.\n\n\n\n",

Sometimes  as  a  demigod,\nsometimes as a human, sometimes as an animal etc. These forms are  neutrally\nawarded according to the gunas or  three  modes  of  goodness,  passion  and\nignorance which adhere in strict accordance to the karma or  reactions  from\npast actions in proportion to the degree of attachment and cravings  one  is\npredisposed  to  pursue  in  order  to  procure  pleasure  and  enjoy  sense\ngratification. Taking birth one launches into activities pursuing  good  and\nevil in order to satisfy and gratify ones desires  and  propensities.  Hence\nis order to exhaust the karma one is  incessantly  creating  by  innumerable\nactions one is born into wombs of good  and  evil  perpetually  in  material\nexistence.

  "13-9": "\nThe words sarvendriya-gunabhasam means that the source  of  the  brahman  or\nspiritual substratum pervading all existence  known  as  Parabrahma  or  the\nSupreme  Being  who  is  capable  of  illuminating  all  the   senses   with\nconsciousness along with their faculties such as sight, sound, smell,  taste\nand touch, etc. But devoid of all material qualities Parabrahma  is  capable\nto perform all the activities of the senses without  the  need  of  physical\nsense organs. The same holds true for the atma or  immortal  soul  which  is\ncapable  of  experiencing  the  activities  of  the  senses  without   sense\nfaculties and which by its own virtue has the capacity of  omniscience  like\nParabrahma.  The  word  asaktam  means  indifferent  or  unattached  to  the\nmaterial and yet is sarva-bhrt  ca  or  capable  of  assuming  all  physical\nbodies and is the maintainer of all physical bodies.

The Supreme Lord is    nirgunam  meaning  transcendental  to\nthe three modes of material nature pervading material  existence  which  are\ngoodness, passion and ignorance  and yet the Supreme Lord  is  the  ultimate\nexperiencer of these three modes. \n\n",

  "13-15": "\n\n\n\n\nThe word karya meaning effect refers to the physical body. The  word  karana\nmeans the instrument of  action  denoting  the  senses  of  perception,  the\norgans of action and the mind. In the activation of both  karya  and  karana\nto function the atma or immortal soul alone  is  the  cause.  This  confirms\nthat all manifest activity by which the jiva or embodied  being  experiences\nexistence is dependent upon prakriti or the  material  substratum  pervading\nphysical existence which is predicated by the  impulses  of  the  atma.  The\natma merely performs its natural function as monitor  and  director  of  the\njiva in all respects. Affirmation of this is given in  the  following  Vedic\naphorism found in the Vedanta Sutra  II:III.XXXX  beginning  krita  prayatna\napekesah meaning the Supreme Lord induces the atma to act according  to  the\neffects experienced by the jiva so that there is  no  contradiction  in  the\nprohibitions and injunctions of the Vedic scriptures. The  function  of  the\natma is to witness the karma or reactions to one's actions  and  govern  the\njiva effects of karma as they evolve and grow. The atma  being  embodied  is\nthe sole cause for a jiva to experience joy and grief through the medium  of\nmatter. Thus the difference in function in regard to both the atma  and  the\nphysical body has been briefly elaborated seperately and in conjunction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process by which the inherently pure and spiritual atma  which  is  most\nblessed comes to experience pleasures and pain  derived  from  contact  with\nproducts of matter is through the  three  gunas  being  modes  of  goodness,\npassion and  ignorance  which  are  effects  of  prakriti  and  figuratively\nsymbolise all derivatives of matter as all matter is within  the  purvey  of\nthe three gunas. Here in this verse the word  purusa  is  referring  to  His\nexpansion as the atma  within the heart of all living entities which by  its\nown intrinsic nature is liberated and  blissful  but  by  the  influence  of\nkarma and  prakriti  is  entangled  in  the  material  existence  undergoing\nexperiences of enjoyment and suffering  based  on  this  relationship  which\nmanifest according to the dicitates and constraints of   the  adventitiously\nand contrary circumstances of past actions from which  arise  effects  known\nas karma. The  word  bhoktrtve  meaning  the  experience  of  happiness  and\ndistress confirms this.\n\n\n\n\n",
  "13-7": "\nLord Krishna is declaring that which is most worthy  to  be  known  is  that\nwhich is most worthy to strive for and be gained and that is realisation  of\nthe atma or immortal soul. This realisation is attained by imbibing  the  20\nattributes heretofore mentioned previously. Here the  word  amritam  meaning\nnectar denotes the nectar of immortality and refers  directly  the  immortal\nsoul exempt from the pangs of birth,  decrepitude  and  death.  Anadi  means\nthat which has no beginning for as the atma has no birth it  has  no  ending\nand is eternal. The Katha Upanisad I.II.XVIII beginning najayate mriyate  va\nvipascit means that the atma is without birth and death. The  compound  mat-\nparam clarifies that the atma is both a part of  the  Supreme  Lord  who  is\npresent within as paramatma the Supreme Soul and always subordinate to  Him.\nThe  Svetasvatara  Upanisad   VI.IX   beginning   sakaranam   karana   dhipa\ndhipo means: The Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes  and  the  lord  of\nthe lord of the senses for Him there is no Lord or  progenitor.  Further  in\nthe same chapter VI.XVI beginning pradhana ksetrajna patir gunesah  meaning:\nThe Supreme Lord who is endowed with all auspicious qualities  is  the  lord\nof the field of activities, the knower of the field of activities.\n\nThe brahman  or  spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  is  great\nbecause the atma which is a separate entity from the physical body  is  part\nof it. Brahman is derived from  the  root  word  brh  which  means  becoming\ngreat. So it is included as part of ksetra-jna. The brahman is infinite  and\nthe atma is infinite as well. The Svetasvatara Upanisad V.IX states   sachan\nanthyaya kalpate  meaning:  The  atma  is  infinite.  The  atma's  seemingly\nlimitation in a physical body  is  due  to  karma  or  reactions  from  past\nactions; but once a jiva or embodied  being  achieves  moksa  or  liberation\nthen the actual infinite and limitless nature of the atma is percieved.  The\nbrahman is neither sat existence or  asat  non-existence  because  it  never\nundergoes any modifications or transformations due to its being  beyond  the\ninfluence of cause and effect. The term brahman can also be  used  to  refer\nto the atma as will be seen later in chapter 14, verse  26  and  chapter  18\nverse 54. When the atma assumes names and forms sat  becomes applicable  and\nwhen the atma is bereft of names and forms it is asat. Thus it is  factually\nbeyond both. This is also revealed in the Tattiriya Upanisad  II.VII.IX  and\nthe Rig Veda VIII.VII.XVII which states: All was asat  in the beginning  and\nfrom it sat arose. So everything was first  unmanifest  and  then  was  made\nmanifest into names and forms through successive  transformations  of  cause\nand effect and such modifications surrounding the atma are due to its  karma\nof having to accept embodiment brought on by avidya or ignorance and is  not\ninherent in the actual nature of the atma itself. Thus  the  nature  of  the\natma is undefinable by any and all conceptions of sat and asat.\n\nWhen the Vedic scriptures refer to asat as being in the beginning  they  are\nalluding to the unmanifest casual state before existence  is  activated  and\ncommences.  In this state both cit conscious spirit as  the  ksetra-jna  and\nacit inert matter as the ksetra are both present but in a dormant state  and\ncould be designated as asat. But the brahman and the atma being eternal  and\npart of the ksetra-jna are transcendent to both sat and asat except  by  the\naccountability and allotment of karma to the  jiva  due  to  reactions  from\npast activities.\n\n",
  "13-1": "\nThe first division of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita known as the Karma  Yoga  section\ncomprises  the  first  six  chapters  describing  two  paths:  the  path  of\nspiritual actions and the path of spiritual knowledge by which  an  aspirant\nmay achieve atma tattva or realisation of the  eternal  soul.  It  has  also\nbeen explained  that  the  achievement  of  atma  tattva  is  essential  for\nattaining moksa or liberation from material existence.\n\nThe middle division  of  Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  known  as  the  Bhakti  Yoga\nsection comprises the second six  chapters  which  reveals  that  bhakti  or\nexclusive loving devotion which is preceded by factual  spiritual  knowledge\nof the Supreme Lord Krishna as revealed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  is  the\nparamount  attainment.  Such  spiritual  knowledge  about  Lord  Krishna  is\nprerequisite and essential to bhakti and subsequent attainment of  communion\nwith the Supreme Lord and eternal association which  is  the  ultimate  goal\nand most exalted destination. It  is  also  elucidated  herein  that  bhakti\nconstitutes the means  by  which  those  aspirants  ambitious  of  acquiring\nopulence and those aspirants ambitious for atma-tattva or  soul  realisation\ncan both have their respective desires fulfilled as well.\n\nNow in the final division of Srimad Bhagavad-Gita known as  the  Jnana  Yoga\nsection comprising the last six  chapters,  the  topics  propounded  in  the\nfirst  12  chapters  will  be  further  illuminated  by  Lord  Krishna.  Two\ncategories will be examined: prakriti or the spiritual substratum  pervading\nphysical existence and Purusa or the Supreme  eternal  consciousness.  Their\ncombined union constitutes the  complete  cosmic  creation.  The  nature  of\nIsvara or the Supreme Lord, the means of salvation, the paths  of  karma  or\nspiritual activities for the Supreme Lord, jnana or spiritual  knowledge  of\nthe Supreme Lord and bhakti or loving devotion to the Supreme Lord  will  be\nfurther delineated along with instructions on how to  practice  and  perform\neach path.\n\nBeginning this Jnana Yoga section,  this  chapter  explains  the  nature  of\nmatter and the soul, the way to realise the  soul  as  distinctly  different\nfrom matter, the reason why the atma is associated with matter and  the  way\nthe atma may be meditated upon.\n\n\nLord Krishna explains that while in a physical body  the  jiva  or  embodied\nbeing believes they are that body, thinking I am a man, I am  a  demigod,  I\nam a female, I am famous, I am powerful, etc. all of  which  are  distinctly\ndifferent form the atma or eternal soul. The physical  body  is  that  which\nthe spiritually intelligent assert as the ksetra or field of enjoyment.  One\nwho has the realisation of  the  jiva  being  part  of  an  aggregate  whole\ncomposed of divisible parts being the physical body,  the  subtle  body  and\nthe atma. One who has the understanding that I know this  body  and  instead\nof the mentality that I am this body. One who is cognisant of  these  things\nand realises  what  the  atma  actually  is  factually   asserted  as  being\nksetrajna or the knower of the field. It can be said that when cognition  of\nobjects external to the physical body arises  the  conception  of  I  am  my\nhuman body who sees for example this house before me, implying that the  one\nwho sees thinks the atma is inseparable from the physical body and not  that\nthe  atma  is  totally  independent  of  the  physical  and  subtle  bodies.\nSubsequently when one has achieved atma tattva or realisation  of  the  soul\nand experienced its spiritual existence then one will be cognisant of  their\nphysical body merely as a house within which the atma inhabits. To  perceive\na house as external from the physical body is the  same  as  perceiving  the\natma as external from the physical body for one who is realised. One who  is\ncognisant of this reality sees the atma  as a distinct entity separate  from\nthe physical and subtle bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo assert the indisputably modifiable and perishable physical body  and  its\nqualitative characteristics to the immortal atma in accordance with the  law\nof coexistence of subject and attribute  is  as  unreasonable  as  asserting\nthat the milk of cattle is an inseparable attribute of every  type  of  cow,\nbull or heifer falling under that generic term.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the fact that the phenomenally unique and sublime nature of the  atma\nprecludes any perceptibility by the senses of  sight,  sound,  taste,  touch\nand smell to experience it and is only perceptible by the  consciousness  of\na clarified mind purified by introspection amd meditation derived  from  the\nprocess of yoga or the science of the  individual  consciousness  perfecting\ncommunion with the ultimate consciousness.  The  spiritually  deficient  are\nbeguiled and bewildered  by  the  mere  propensity  of  matter  and  deluded\nmisconstrue the perishable physical body and  the  eternal,  immortal  atma.\nThis will be further clarified in chapter 15, verses 10 and  11  where  Lord\nKrishna explains that those bereft of wisdom  with  impure  thoughts  cannot\nperceive the atma.\n\n\n",

The five perceptual senses being the eyes, ears, nose,  tongue  and\ntouch corresponding respectively with their five objects being  the  visual,\nauditory, olfactory, gustatory and tactual; along with the  five  senses  of\nactivity being the vocal, the prehensible  the  hands,  the  locomotive  the\nlegs,  procreative  the  generative  organs  and  the  excretory  organ  for\nevacuation.

Otherwise one will misuse their  precious  human  form  of\nexistence to procure material happiness on Earth while experiencing joy  and\ngrief in doing so and take another birth  in  usually  a  lower  species  of\nlife; or to perform activities in an attempt to procure  entrance  into  the\nheavenly planets to enjoy celestial delights as a demigod  for  an  allotted\ntime period but which may or may not guarantee success and  one  has  to  be\nborn again; or to strive for moksa or liberation from  the  cycle  of  birth\nand death to achieve an impersonal beatitude  but  if  failing  in  this  is\nforced to take birth again in one of  the  8,400,000  some  species  in  the\nmaterial existence as well.\n\nThis is what is available in the ksetra.

  "13-28": "\n\nAnother analogy is utilized by Lord Krishna  in  how  the  sun  is  able  to\nsolely illuminate the entire universe.  In the same way  does  paramatma  or\nthe Supreme Soul illuminate all the atmas or immortal souls in creation  and\nthen each individual atma illuminates with consciousness the  tabernacle  of\nthe physical body of every jiva or embodied being in which  it  inhabits  in\nthat lifetime. This consciousness exists completely throughout the  physical\nbody surrounding it as well to some degree and definitively thinks that  the\nphysical body is its ksetra or field of activity. It  should  be  understood\nthat just as the sun in  its  capacity  of  illumination  differs  from  the\nuniverse it illuminates. In the  same  way  it  should  be  understood  that\nparamatma is supremely different from all individual atmas  even  though  it\nilluminates them all with consciousness and in the same manner it should  be\nunderstood that the localized atma is uniquely different from its ksetra  of\nthe body.\n\n",
  "13-27": "\n\nLord Krishna uses the word akasam which means ether and  denotes  space.  As\nspace prevails everywhere and encompasses all objects, yet by its  extremely\nsubtle nature the properties of any object are not able to influence,  taint\nor modify it. In the same way the atma or  individual  immortal  soul  being\nsubatomic resides within the bodies of all jivas or embodied beings but  the\nphysical properties, attributes and qualities that pertain  to  such  bodies\nbe they demigods, human, animal, etc. are  unable  to  influence,  taint  or\nmodify it.\n\n",
  "13-2": "\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord Krishna is explaining that He is in fact the ksetrajnam  or\ncognizant consciousness abiding within all jivas or embodied  souls  in  its\ncapacity of vivifying all tenements in  deva  or  demigods,  human,  animal,\nbird, fish etc. and all living entities who are mad-atmakam or  ensouled  by\nHim and in possession of a  soul  and  not  those  artificially  created  or\ncloned who are without an atma or  eternal  soul.  The  adverb  api  meaning\nfurthermore in the expression capi mam viddhi meaning know me  also,  infers\nthat the ksetra is also under Lord Krishna's complete control as  well.  The\nactual purport is that just as the ksetra or physical  body  is  apprehended\nsolely as the inseparable adjunct of the ksetra-jna which is  designated  as\nthe atma; by the law of correlation of subject and  predicate  so  are  both\nthe ksetra and the ksetra-jna of all  sentient  beings  in  creation  to  be\nunderstood as being inseparable adjuncts to the Supreme  Lord  Krishna.   It\nwill be pointed out subsequently that Parabrahman who is the  actual  source\nof the brahman or the spiritual substratum pervading all existence  and  who\nis  known  as  Vasudeva  an  expansion  of  Lord  Krishna  is  a  distinctly\ntranscendental postulate of existence  separate  from  even  the  ksetra-jna\nwhich is the atma and this is totally independent of the jiva in a state  of\nmoksa or baddha being liberation and bondage  respectively  which  are  also\nknown by kshara or unliberated perishable souls  and  akshara  or  liberated\nimperishable souls. Later in chapter 15 verses 16, 17 and  18  Lord  Krishna\nconfirms that there are two kinds of atmas in this world  the  fallible  and\nthe infallible. The fallible refers to the kshara and is the  sum  total  of\nall unliberated souls in existence the infallible refers to the akshara  and\nis the eternal, infinite and sovereign param?tm? or the Supreme  Soul  which\nenters into all beings and sustains them. Since the Supreme  Lord  surpasses\nthe kshara and even excels the akshara as well He is  known  as  Purusottama\nthe Supreme Personality.\n\nThe ksetra is the composite of the material elements of earth,  water,  air,\nfire and ether. The ksetra-jna comprises the spiritual bodies of  all  souls\nin existence which qualitatively constitute the transcendental body  of  the\nSupreme Lord Krishna who is the Supreme Soul of  all.  The  following  Vedic\nscripture confirms: The Brihad-aranyaka Upanisad  V.VII.III  beginning   yah\nprithivyam tishthan meaning : Who is situated  in  the  Earth,  who  is  the\ninterior of the Earth, whom the Earth knows not,  to  who  the  Earth  is  a\nbody, who rules the Earth from within, such a one is He the  atma,  eternal,\nimmortal and sovereign. Further in the same scripture  V.VII.XXII  beginning\nya atmani tishthan meaning:  Who  is  situated  in  the  atma,  who  is  the\ninterior of the atma, whom the atma knows not, to whom the atma is  a  body,\nwho rules the atma from within, such a one is He as  paramatma  the  Supreme\nSoul eternal, immortal and sovereign.\n\nReference to the Supreme Lord in terms of ksetra-jnam etc. are justified  in\nacccordance with the law of correlation of subject and  predicate  evidenced\nbefore with the predicate signifying the abidance of  the  Supreme  Lord  as\nthe ksetrajnam within all ksetra-jna's as the paramatma within  all  atma's,\ninternally monitoring and governing at all times  all  beings  in  existence\neverywhere throughout all creation. This law  of  correlation  was  evidence\nearlier in chapter ten verse 20 where Lord Krishna reveals that  He  is  the\natma situated within the etheric heart of all jivas or embodied  beings.  In\nverse 21 He proclaims that of the 12 Adityas, He is Vishnu. In verse  39  He\ndeclares that nothing in all creation  which  moves  or  is  stationary  can\nexist without Him and in verse 42 validates that He maintains and  energizes\nthe complete creation  and  total  cosmic  manifestation  with  but  a  mere\nfraction of His  expansion.   So  with  this  clearly  in  mind  one  should\ncomprehend that the Supreme Lord Krishna highly  esteems  as  worth  knowing\nthe knowledge concerning the distinction between the ksetra and the  ksetra-\njna and the knowledge that Lord  Krishna  is  the  atma  of  all  beings  in\nexistence.\n\nContrarily some scholars and pandits interpret this  verse  of  knowing  the\nksetrajna to be  the Supreme Lord as a means to establish unity by the  rule\nof common reference. In this case having to expound upon a united  existence\nthey postulate that the Supreme Lord is  seen  as  the  ksetrajna  by  which\nthrough ignorance duality of the cognizant  and  the  incognizant  which  is\nimplied  has to be acknowledged and that the  inculcation  of  unity  is  to\ndispel this ignorance. The explanation given is that the  ignorance  arising\nfrom the dualistic  conception  of  the  ksetra-jna  is  dispelled  by  such\ninstructors interpretations of the wisdom emanating from the  mouth  of  the\nSupreme Lord Himself the same as the instructor  who  teaches  that  a  rope\ntouched in the darkness is  not  a  snake  and  causes  the  imagined  snake\ndisappears. Such interpretations must be seriously questioned  as  to  their\nveracity.\n1) If the instructor who teaches the unequivocal wisdom  emanating  directly\nfrom the Supreme Lord Himself in any of His  incarnations  or  expansions\nand fully understands them,  then  there  is  no  question  of  ignorance\narising from dualistic conceptions as they are dispelled at the root  and\natma tattva or soul realization is soon forthcoming.\n2) If the instructor whose ignorance supposedly has been  dispelled  on  the\ndawning of atma tattva to then imagine that which is purely spiritual and\nnirvesa or without material qualities and which is pure consciousness and\npostulate it to be a  contrary  reflection  of  dualistic  antithesis  is\nhighly objectionable in the same way as considering  rain  and  water  as\ndualistic.\n3) If the instructor adheres to the  dualistic  conception  of  the  Supreme\nLord does not perceive Him as the one  absolute,  omnipotent,  omniscient\nand omnipresent reality perpetually manifest in all creation then  it  is\nobvious that atma  tattva  has  not  consummated  and  been  achieve  and\ntherefore His ignorance has not been dispelled. Therefore those  who  are\nin ignorance themselves have no qualification to impart  knowledge of the\natma or eternal soul to others because they have not realized it either.\n\nIn chapter four, verse  34  Lord  Krishna  states:  upadeksyanti  te  jnanam\njnaninas tattva-darsinah meaning saintly souls endowed with  the  wisdom  of\ndivine revelation will impart  spiritual  knowledge.  So  in  conclusion  it\nshould be succinctly comprehended that all polemics  of  this  nature  which\nare  opposed  to  the  siddhanta  or  conclusive  truth  of  all  the  Vedic\nscriptures as well as logic and  reason  and  which  instead  ostentatiously\nimposes a degraded and erroneous hypothesis upon the world deserves  not  to\nbe further addressed.\n\nThe factual reality of existence is found in the evidence and  proofs  found\nin Vedic scriptures which confirm distinctive  characteristics of :\n1) the experienced which is inherent deep within the nature of acit or  non-\nsentient matter\n2) the experiencer which is inherent  deep  within  the  nature  of  cit  or\nconsciousness\n3) paramesvaram or the supreme controller inherent within every particle  of\ncreation\n\nThe Vedic scriptures themselves declare this as  reality  as  the  following\nexamples illustrate from the Svetasvatara Upanisad. In verse V.IX  beginning\nasman mayi srijate  visvam  means  that  from  matter  the  illusory  nature\nconstructs the creation. In verse V.X  beginning  mayantu  prakritim  vidyan\nmayinam tu maheshvaram means that the illusory energy to  be  verily  matter\nwhich the Supreme Lord  is  far  beyond.  In  verse  I.X  beginning  ksharam\npradhanam amritaksharam means that which is perishable is  matter  and  that\nwhich is imperishable is the eternal soul and that which rules both  is  the\nSupreme Lord. In verse VI.II beginning sa kara  jam  karapadhipadhipo  means\nthe Supreme Lord is the cause, He is the Lord of matter, He is the  Lord  of\nthe soul, there is no other god above Him, He is the supreme  ruler  of  all\nmatter and all souls. In verse I.VI beginning prithag atmanam preitaram  and\nmeans the soul and the Supreme Lord  are  distinct  and  different  whom  by\nserving the soul achieves immortality. In  verse  I.IX  beginning  jnanajnau\ndvav-ajav-isanisau means the Supreme Lord is  the  omniscient  one  and  the\nsoul is not, both are eternal but only the Supreme Lord  is  the  controller\nof all. In verse I.XII beginning bhokta bhogya  preritaram  means  one  must\nhave knowledge of matter, the soul and the Supreme Lord.  In  verse  VI.XIII\nbeginning nityo nityanam means the Supreme Lord is the eternal Lord  of  all\nsouls, the Supreme  of  the  Supreme,  who  bequeaths  desires.  In  Mundaka\nUpanisad  III.I.I  beginning  tayor  anyah  pippalalm  svadvatti  means  the\nindividual soul reaps the results of actions while the Supreme Soul    reaps\nnot and illuminates everywhere. In the  Taittiriya  Upanisad  X.V  beginning\najam ekam lohita-sukla-krsnam means verily a unliberated  jiva  or  embodied\nbeing embraces material existence in the form of  matter  and  enjoys  light\nand water and food and in answer to one's wishes  bestows  manifold  progeny\nwhile a  liberated  jiva  discards  material  existence  after  tasting  its\ndelights. Also in  the  Tattiriya  Upanisad  XI.I  beginning  patim  visvasy\natmesvaram sasvatam means the Supreme Lord is the Lord of all creation,  the\nLord of all souls, eternal  and  everlasting.  Again  in  the  Svestasvatara\nUpanisad IV.VII beginning samane vrikshe purusho nimagno means  dwelling  in\nthe same field of activity as  paramatma  the  Supreme  Soul,  the  atma  or\nindividual soul immersed  in  the  machinations  of  material  existence  is\nsuffering greatly oblivious; but  when  the  atma  perceives  paramatma  the\nworshipable Supreme Lord's localized manifestation in all its  glory  within\nthe etheric heart of  all  living  entities.  completely  transcendental  to\nmaterial nature, above and beyond the machinations  of  material  existence;\nthen all suffering ceases.\n\nThe Supreme Lord is pradhana-ksetrajnam-patir  gunesah  meaning  He  is  the\nlord of all attributes and qualities in all fields of activity. Many  verses\nspoken by Lord Krishna in Bhagavad-Gita corroborate this. Such as in  VII.IV\nbeginning bhumir apo'nalo vayuh referring to His eight fold energies of  the\nmaterial energy. In VII. 5 beginning apareyam itas  te  anyam  referring  to\nthe atma or soul and His superior spiritual energies. In  IX.VII   beginning\nsarva bhutani kaunteya explaining how  all  living  entities  are  retracted\nback into His nature and later distinctly  created  and  emitted  again.  In\nIX.VIII beginning prakrtim svam avastabhya He continues explaining  how  His\nagency of material nature manifests the jivas  or  embodied  entities  again\nand again millennium after millennium according to their karma or  reactions\nto their actions.  In  IX.X  beginning  mayadhyaksena  prakrtih  he  further\nexplains how His sakti or feminine potency creates all  things  mutable  and\nimmutable and thus creation is manifest again and again.  Then  in  XIII.IXX\nbeginning prakrtim purusam He will confirm the eternality  of  the  atma  or\nsoul and that material nature is without  beginning  and  later  in  XIV.III\nbeginning mama yonir mahad-brahma He explains  that  the  complete  material\nexistence is the womb wherein  He  germinates  all  souls  that  exist  from\nBrahma to the lowest one-celled living entity and impels  their  birth  into\nbeing. The yoni or womb is the vast cosmic  manifestation  and  prakriti  is\nthe supra-subtle material substratum pervading physical existence  which  is\nachit or unconscious and inanimate.  Into  this  the  Supreme  Lord  by  His\nglance projects the infinitesimal embryonic seed which is chit or  conscious\nand animate. Thereafter by His will they are united  and  by  this  compound\nalone all living beings created from matter are brought into existence  from\nthe highest demi-god to lower then a one-celled amoeba are  al  embodied  in\nvarious corporeal and subtle  bodies.  The  word  brahma  or  the  spiritual\nsubstratum pervading all existence denotes the primal  root  source  of  all\nelements and is evidenced in the Vedic  scripture  Mundaka  Upanisad  I.I.IX\nbeginning  tasmad  etat  brahma  meaning  by  the  Supreme  Lords  will  the\nunmanifested cosmic creation and the manifested cosmic creation arise.\n\nSimilarly other Vedic scriptures  solemnly  declare  that  the  animate  and\ninanimate of chit and achit and all conditions existing in relation  to  the\nexperience and the experiencer both constitute the transcendental  spiritual\nbody of the Supreme Lord and subject  to  His  will  relate  to  Him  in  an\nindissoluble dependent  and  subservient  position  eternally  and  that  an\ninfinitesimal portion of  the  Supreme  Lord  is  present  as  the  atma  or\nimmortal soul within all living entities. Thus the Supreme Lord is the  root\ncause and underlying basis  for  everything  in  existence  and  all  living\nentities in both spiritual and material.\n\nReferences  from  other  Vedic  scriptures  confirming  this  are  given  as\nfollows. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad V.VII.III beginning  yah  prithviyam\ntisthan meaning: Who is seated in the Earth. Whom the Earth  knows  not.  To\nwhom the Earth is the body. Who from inside of the Earth rules.  It  is  the\nSupreme Soul, the ruler of  all,  immortal.  Commencing  thus  in  the  same\nUpanisad in verse  V.VII.XXII  beginning  ya  atmani  tisthan  meaning:  Who\nseated in the soul. Whom the soul knows not. To whom the soul is  the  body.\nWho from inside of the soul rules. He is the  Supreme  Soul,  the  ruler  of\nall, immortal. In  chapter  seven  of  the  Subala  Upanisad  we  find  many\nexamples beginning with: yah prithivim antare sancharan meaning: Who  moving\nin the interior of the Earth. To whom Earth is the body. To whom  the  Earth\nknows not; and yo aksaram  antare  sancharam  meaning:  Who  moving  in  the\ninterior of the soul. Whom the soul is the body. Whom the  soul  knows  not;\nand yo  mrityum  antare  sancharan  meaning:  who  moving  in  the  material\nsubstratum. To whom the material substratum is the body. Whom  the  material\nsubstratum knows not; and esa sarva bhut  antar  atma  meaning  the  Supreme\nLord is the Supreme Soul of all beings, immortal,  immaculate,  divine.  The\nterm mrityu quoted  above  refers  to  the  subtle  state  of  the  material\nsubstratum within inanimate objects and substances known by the  appellation\ntamas or darkness. In chapter two of the Subala Upanisad beginning  avaktyam\naksara meaning  the  unmanifest    merges  into  the  imperishable  and  the\nmanifest merges into tamas. \nIn the Tattiriya Aranyaka III.X  beginning  antah  pravishta  sasta  jananam\nmeaning: Existing within all, the ruler of all creatures, the  Supreme  Soul\npervades all.\n\nNow will be given references from  other  Vedic  scriptures  as  well  which\nconfirm and explicitly express the truth that the Supreme Lord alone is  the\nsubject, predicated by the compounded bodies  of  all  sentient  beings  and\ninsentient elements existing in every condition and that  the  Supreme  Lord\nis solely existent as the potential and as the actual manifestation  of  all\ncreation.  In  the  Chandogya  Upanisad  V1.II.I  beginning  sad  eva  somya\nmeaning: This sat or eternal existence  of  the  Supreme  Lord  was  in  the\nbeginning all there was; and in VI.II.III beginning tad aikshata bahu  shyam\nmeaning: The Supreme Lord willed that He  become  many  and  multiplied  and\nmanifested illumination; and in VI.VIII.VI beginning  san  mulas  somy  emas\nsarvam meaning:  Eternal  existence  of  the  Supreme  is  the  root  source\nmanifesting  all  creation  and  its  support  and   maintenance;   and   in\nVI.VIII.VII beginning aitad atmyam idam  sarvam  meaning:  All  creation  is\nensouled by the eternal existence of the  Supreme  Lord.  In  the  Tattiriya\nUpanisad II.VI.II beginning so kama yata bahusyam meaning: The Supreme  Lord\nwilled may I be manifold and  meditating  thus  He  expanded  creation  with\nunlimited  beings  also  in  II.VI.III  of  the   aforementioned   scripture\nbeginning satyan chanritali ca meaning: Both the eternal  soul  as  well  as\nperishable matter emanate from the ultimate truth of the Supreme Lord.  This\nconfirms what  has  been  described  in  the  Chandogya  Upanisad  VI.III.II\nbeginning hanta ham imas tisro devatas and means: The Supreme  Lord  as  the\nSupreme Soul interpenetrates all existence  and  material  principles  being\nfire, earth, air, water and ether as well as manifesting  names  and  forms.\nThis clearly illustrates the distinct  differences  between  cit  being  the\natma or eternal soul, acit being perishable  matter  and  Isvara  being  the\nSupreme Lord. The Taittiriya Upanisad  II.VI.II  beginning  tat  sristi  tva\ndeclares: After creating the complete cosmic manifestation comprised of  all\nthings sentient and insentient and permeating all  things  sentient  as  the\natma or eternal soul and all things insentient as  their  eternal  subatomic\nessence. One being constant and immutable and the other being  variable  and\nmutable both being separate manifestations of the Supreme Lord.\n\nWith the consensus of the preceding  Vedic  references   agreeing  that  the\nSupreme Lord  is  manifesting  both  the  conscious  imperishable  soul  and\nunconscious perishable matter with  the  embodiment  of  both  as  jivas  or\nembodied beings; it can be ascertained that the principle being  established\nthroughout is the reality of immanent co-existence between  the  omnipresent\natma and unlimited living entities. The manifestation of all  the  unlimited\nnames and forms by the  Supreme  Lord  is  confirmed  in  the  Brhadaranyaka\nUpanisad III.IV.VII  beginning  taddhedam  tarhi  meaning:  Before  all  was\nunmanifest and later it was subsequently  manifested  by  the  Supreme  Lord\ninto names and forms.\n\nThus it is established and clarified that the  Supreme  Lord  alone  is  the\noriginator of all whatever is chit or  conscious  and  animate  as  well  as\nwhatever is achit or unconscious and inanimate. He alone  is  the  principle\nof cause when both chit and achit are unmanifest in an imperceptible  supra-\nsubtle state and He alone is the principle of effect when they are  manifest\nin a perceptible physical state. Therefore identifying the Supreme  Lord  as\nthe sole source of  everything and its ancillary causes and effects one  can\nthen comprehend that knowledge of Him is knowledge of  both  and  that  only\nknowledge of the Supreme  Lord  is  complete  knowledge.  In  the  Chandogya\nUpanisad VI.III.II mentioned  previously  beginning  hanta  ham  imas  tisro\ndevatas the word hanta refers to the life force of  the  Supreme  Soul.  The\nword devatas refers to the three  states  consisting  of  1)  everything  in\nmasse that is achit or unconscious in substance, 2) all  jivas  or  embodied\nbeings in whatever form they possess gross or subtle and 3) atma  being  the\nimmortal soul is a direct infinitesimal spark of the Supreme  Lord  Himself.\nBy understanding this it is evident that all names  are  sound  symbols  and\nhave a direct relationship to the  Supreme  Lord  activated  by  matter  and\nspirit or body and soul. Hence the rule of identity of  substance  with  its\nadjuncts finds its primary application in terms corrollating to the  Supreme\nLord as cause and such appellations give reference and  signifies  His  mode\nas the source of effect as well. Since the brahman or  spiritual  substratum\npervading all existence, being a direct manifestation of  the  Supreme  Lord\nis the cause containing both the atmas and matter in their subtle state;  as\nwell as the effect  containing  both  body  and  spirit  in  their  physical\nmanifestation; the brahman can be said to  be  the  cause  of  the  material\nmanifestation of creation.  Although  the  brahman  may  be  considered  the\nmaterial cause, the brahman is not in any  way  material  and  there  is  no\nintermingling or sharing of the essences of the brahman with matter  or  the\natma. An example is a piece of colored cloth,  the  material  cause  is  the\ncombination of multicolored threads yellow, blue  and  red  running  through\nit. Although the cloth is considered as a single substance constituted as  a\nwhole, the qualities of the different colored threads are  confined  to  the\narea of the cloth where they occur. In the same manner when the compound  of\nmatter, the atma and the brahman is declared to be the material  cause,  the\neffect of this cause is  the  material  creation.  So  their  should  be  no\nconfusion concerning the distinctive  characteristics  of  the  experiencer,\nthe  experieince,  or  the  controller  of  all  being   three   distinctive\nprinciples combining to  manifest  the  entire  cosmos  and  correlating  to\nproduce the effect of  matter,  soul  and  Supreme  Lord.  Yet  there  is  a\ndifference between the colored cloth because all of the threads are able  to\nbe separated; whereas matter and the soul in all  ways  and  all  conditions\nconstitute the transcendental body of the Supreme Lord. It is a  case  where\nthe indiscernible attributive character  of  matter  and  the  imperceptible\nnature of the atma or eternal soul as essences are  integral  parts  of  the\ntranscendental substantive qualities of  the  Supreme  Lord  as  a  compound\nunit. Thus the Supreme Lord alone is  both  the  cause  and  effect  of  the\nconscious atma as well as insentient matter and it is  He  alone  upon  whom\nevery verbal symbol and annotation ultimately connotes.\n\nAs  for  the  differences  in  the   components   of   the   Supreme   Lords\nmanifestations and their non-interchangeable  natures  the  analogy  of  the\nseparate threads of colored cloth  is  applicable.  When  this  is  properly\nunderstood it is evident that the cause of all causes is the   Supreme  Lord\nKrishna and although as the source of all He enters His components into  the\neffects there is no transformation of His essential essence  and  never  any\ntransmutation of His transcendental immutable nature. That He is the  effect\nas well is understandable by  He being the cause of the effect,  for  effect\nis actually the cause in a modified form. The contention  that  the  Supreme\nLord is nirguna-vada or devoid of qualities  is  only  valid  and  justified\nwhen referring to material qualities. Another example is  when  the  Supreme\nLord is said to be immaculate or devoid of any sin. This does  not  preclude\nthat the Supreme  Lord  is  without  transcendental  attributes  and  divine\nqualities  it  is  just  that  His  attributes  and  qualities  are   purely\nspiritual. The Vedic scriptures confirm  this.  In  the  Chandogya  Upanisad\nVIII.I-V beginning apa hata papana meaning: The Supreme  Lord  is  destitute\nof sin, affliction, hunger, thirst,  decrepitude  and  death.  In  the  same\npassage beginning satya kamas satya sankalpah meaning: The Supreme  Lord  is\nwithout  desires,  self-sufficient,  of  infallible  will  and   indomitable\nnature. So after expunging the lack of  material  deficiencies  the  virtues\nare expounded, affirmatively establishing the correct  context  of  what  is\nwritten in various Vedic scriptures about  being  devoid  of  qualities  and\nthat this factually means devoid of any material qualities.\n\nNext the discrepancy that the brahman or spiritual substratum pervading  all\nexistence is not a conscious entity of the Supreme Lord  who  is  completely\nomniscient and omnipotent and who is endowed with all superlative  qualities\nand sublime attributes of goodness and is the  antithesis  to  all  that  is\nnegative  and  evil  which  is  defined  by   the   primary   attribute   of\nconsciousness  which  exclusively  categorises  Him   and   His   authorised\nincarnations as being Self-Illuminated. The Vedic  scriptures  confirm  this\nsuch as: The Mundaka Upanisad II.II.VII  beginning  yas  sarvajnas  meaning:\nThe Supreme Lord is omniscient and all knowing.  The  Svetasvatara  Upanisad\nIV.VIII beginning para sya sakti meaning: The transcendental nature  of  the\nSupreme Lord is manifold and also  are  His  divine  attributes  of  wisdom,\npower  and  activities.  The  Brihadaranya  Upanisad   IV.IV.XIV   beginning\nvijnataram are meaning By His transcendental qualities the Supreme  Lord  is\nto be known and proclaims Him as the  most  conscious  of  all  beings.  The\nTattiriya Upanisad II.I.I beginning satyam jnanam meaning: The Supreme  Lord\nis truth, wisdom and consciousness this is proclaimed by His  being  defined\nas  the  ultimate  expression  of  truth  and  wisdom   and   the   ultimate\nconsciousness fully  self-effulgent.  In  the  Tattiriya  Upanisad  II.VI.II\nbeginning sa kamayata meaning:  The  Supreme  Lord  willed  that  He  become\nunlimitedly manifold. In the  Chandogya  Upanisad  VI.II.III  beginning  tad\naikshata meaning The Supreme Lord contemplated that  He  expand  and  become\nunlimitedly  multitudinous.  In  the  Brihadaranyaka   Upanisad   III:IV:VII\nbeginning  tanama  rupa  bhyam  meaning:  The  Supreme  Lord  fashioned  the\nmanifold into names and forms. Again in the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad  VI.V.VI\nbeginning  atmani  khalv-are  meaning:  When  the  eternal  soul  within  is\nperceived, experienced, witnessed, meditated upon and  understood  then  all\nbecomes known. Again  in  the  Brihadaranyaka  Upanisad  VI.V.VII  beginning\nsarvam tam paradat meaning: All that is witnessed is to be  rejected  except\nthe witnessing of the eternal  soul  within.  Again  in  the  Brihadaranyaka\nUpanisad VI.V.XI beginning tasya ha meaning: What is the  Rig  Vedas  except\nverily the breath of the Supreme Lord.\n\nThis reveals that  the  Supreme  Lord  alone  is  parabrahman  the  Ultimate\nconsciousness  permeating the spiritual substratum pervading  all  existence\nand by His  self-will  alone  He  is  existent  in  all  forms  movable  and\nimmovable. Certainly it is impossible for  any  type  of   consciousness  or\nexistence singular or manifold to  manifest  without  the  brahman  and  the\neternal soul. There is absolutely  no  variation  or  configuration  of  any\nsentient being that could  exist  without  the  atma  or  eternal  soul  and\nlikewise nothing insentient can  exist  without  the  brahman  or  spiritual\nsubstratum pervading all existence. This is declared and  confirmed  in  the\nVedic scriptures that follow. In the Brihadaranayaka Upanisad IV.IV.XIX  and\nalso the Katha Upanisad IV.X:XI beginning mrityos sa  mrityum  meaning:  Who\nperceives in the brahman the lack of diversity deserves to die and be  bound\nin  samsara  the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and  death.  Again   in   the\nBrihadaranyaka Upanisad VI.IV.XIX beginning neha nana asti meaning:  Nowhere\nin the brahman is there  limited  diversity.  Again  in  the  Brihadaranyaka\nUpanisad beginning yatra hi dvaitam meaning: Although  in  the  brahman  may\nappear to be duality. And finally in  the  Brihadaranyaka  Upanisad  VI.V.XV\nbeginning tad itana itaram meaning: All appears separate  to  one  who  does\nnot see the soul but to one who sees the  soul  all  is  seen.  Nor  is  the\nmultitudinous of forms manifesting from the brahman alone  as  is  confirmed\nin such Vedix scriptures as  the   Chandogya  Upanisad  VI.II.III  beginning\nbahu syam prajayoga meaning: May I be multitudinous, may I procreate,  which\naffirms the reality that  the  Supreme  Lords  by  His  own  will  manifests\nunlimited names and forms through His potency of the brahman.\n\nSo it can be comprehended that the Vedic scriptures have established that:\n1) The essential difference between the  Supreme  Lord  and  brahman,  chit,\nachit and atma.\n2) The qualitative differences amongst them.\n3) The law of cause and effect.\n4) The relativity of cause and effect.\n\nThus it can be realized that a comprehensive  harmony  is  existing  amongst\nall the Vedic scriptures by the Vedic scriptures  themselves  and  there  is\nnot the least contradiction to one who has received  the  knowledge  of  the\nVedas from the bonafide spiritual master  in  one  of  the  four  authorised\nsampradaya's revealed in Vedic scriptures. Nor is  there  any  necessity  to\nhypothecate contrary conclusions or erroneous suppositions such as  brahman-\najana-vada or duality of the brahman due to ignorance  which  was  Sankara's\nfalse contention and  aupadhior  ka-brahma-bheda-vada  meaning  the  brahman\nbecomes dualistic because of limiting conditions which was Bhaskara's  false\ncontention. So in conclusion let us take leave of such faulty  tenets  based\non fallacy and which are  opposed  to  the  reality  of  the  eternal  Vedic\nscriptures.\n\n",

The result of  such  actions  is  only\nincreasing one's bhakti or exclusive loving devotion to  the  Supreme  Lord.\nPurity means the absence of any pain so say sages who are in a  position  to\nknow such matters. The result of those situated in raja guna or the mode  of\npassion at the moment of death is birth among those prodiguous families  who\nonly perform  activities  desirous  of  rewards.  They  actually  engage  in\nactions with  the  sole  intent  of  enjoying  the  results  themselves  and\ngratifying their dependents and then again and again embarking on  more  and\nmore ventures developing more and more passion as they  do.  Hence  do  they\nperpetuate a mountain of karma or reactions to  actions,  some  good  giving\npleaure  and  some  bad  giving  pain.  Thus  they   perpetuate   themselves\npermanently into samsara the perpetual cycle of birth and  death.

Purity  and  clarity  is  that  which  negates\nobscuration of brightness and happiness. As illumination and  happiness  can\nonly result from sattva it  is  understood  to  be  their  cause.  The  word\nprakasakam means illuminates, enlightens, reveals the  exact  knowledge  of.\nThe word anamayam means of peaceful quality,  that  which  has  no  inherent\ncause for producing discomfort, pain or sickness  denoting  that  sattva  is\nthe cause of good health.

When  the\ndispositions for happiness and knowledge arise  in  life  one  embarks  upon\nsuch worldly material enterprises and spiritual pursuits  as  correlates  to\nthe level of one's developement and evolution. Hence the jiva  is  propelled\nto take birth in such wombs that are favorably suited fot the  enjoyment  of\none's karma or resultant reactions to actions which arising  out  of  sattva\nare positive. Born in sattva the inclinations and disposition that  one  has\nagain gravitates towrds happiness and knowledge and in this way lifetime  by\nlifetime in sattva guna the mode of goodness  one  has  the  opportunity  to\nadvance in spiritual life.

  "14-7": "\nLord Krishna explains that the mode of passion is known as rajas and is  the\ncause of sexual desires known as carnal  lust.  From  rajas  arises  trishna\nwhich is desire for all forms of sensual enjoyments through  the  medium  of\nthe senses such as seeing, hearing,  tasting,  smelling  and  feeling.  Also\narising from rajas is sanga or desire to be in the  association  of  family,\nfriends  and  loved  ones.  Thus  rajas  encourages  desires  and   promotes\nactivities to enjoy such desires which binds one to the reactions of  merits\nor demerits and keeps the jiva or embodied being  incessantly  revolving  in\nsamsara or the perpetual cycle of  birth  and  death.  This  propensity  for\nconstantly performing actions is inherent and also causes the jiva  to  take\nbirth at a specific place with a  particular  body  suitable  to  enjoy  the\nrewards of previous actions. Hence by instigating the desire for  performing\nworks one is kept in bondage. In this way rajas is  known  to  be  the  root\ncause of lust, sensual desires and attachment.\n\n",

The  word  amalan  means  pure,  exempt  from  blemish,\ndenoting devoid of ignorance.

It is also the  cause\nof  alasya or  indolence  slothlike  laziness  which  is  the  inability  to\nproperly execute any  endeavor  properly  and  nidrabhih  or  sleep  is  the\ndisinclination of the senses to function  terminating  all  activities.  All\nthese things nibadhanti or binds  one  to  the  material  existence  without\nreprieve.The  sublation  of  the  external  senses  constitutes  the   dream\nstate;but when the mind is  also  sublated  then  the  dream  state  becomes\nsleep.\n\n",

Similarly  if  one  dies\nwhile under the influnce of tama guna or the mode  of  ignorance  then  such\njivas will be born from the wombs of animals such as  pigs  and  dogs  where\none would be completely incapacitated to perform  any  activity  that  would\ngive any spiritual benefit.\n\n",

Those  who  have  acquired  this\nknowledge and realised its wisdom having transcended are  exempt  from  both\nand subject to neither birth or death.  The explanation of how all  existing\nbeings result in their forms by the combination of  matter  and  spirit  and\nhow the qualities of prakriti or the material substratum pervading  physical\nexistence come to manifest was already eloquently delineated in  chapter  13\nverse 22.\n\n\n",

The  results  of  their\neffects is that the immutable atma or immortal  soul  is  nibadhnanti  which\nmeans enslaved by material sentiments of the mind. Due to this the  atma  is\nimpounded in a body as a captive, forced to be manufactured as a jiva or  an\nembodied being and subject to birth and death within the body of a  demigod,\nhuman, animal, fish, etc.  The  characteristics  of  the  individual  guna's\nalong with their method of imprisoning the jiva is  given  by  Lord  Krishna\nnext.\n\n",

Those who are  situated\nin raja guna or the  mode  of  passion  have  the  desire  for  rewards  for\nthecause of  actions engage in activities that give them  the  results  they\nwish to exploit and enjoy. Maintaining this mentality they engage  fully  in\nsuch fruitive activities life after life and are born  again  and  again  to\nengage  in  more  and  more  works.  Hence  since  it  insures  a   constant\nreoccurrence of material  births  it  is  full  of  misery.  Those  who  are\nsituated in tama guna or the mode of ignorance are engaged  in  degenerative\nbehaivior and descend downwards  doing  more  and  more  despicable  inhuman\nactivities. Such beings development is in retrograde and after becoming  the\nlowest types of humanity such as cannibals and perverts of beastiality  they\nsink into the animal species themselves. After that  due  to  the  reactions\nfrom their heinious activitie they  become worms and maggots and  then  they\neven descend into the lowest of plants to  become  stationary  creepers  and\nfungus.So Lord Krishna has revealed how the jiva or embodied being rises  in\nevolution and how it descends. All those who adopt  and  maintain  a  strict\nvegetarian diet as detailed in chapter 6, verse 17 and chapter  17  verse  8\nand who perform activities as a matter of duty without impetus  for  rewards\ngradually become  fully  situated  in  sattva  guna  and  eventually  ascend\nperforming all activities for the satifaction for the Supreme Lord.\n\n\n",

But  they  only\ncomprise His external energy and are inferior.  The  mahad-brahma  signifies\nthe infinite extension of prakriti  or  the  material  substratum  pervading\nphysical  existence  by  dint  of  its  being  the  primal  source  of   all\nvariegations   of   species   and   subspecies   which    emanate    thereof\ncorrespondingly in the forms of manas, buddhi and ahankara.  Passages  found\nin  various  Vedic  scriptures  sometime  refer  to   prakriti  in  specific\ncircumstances  in  the  purview  of  the  brahman  or  spiritual  substratum\npervading all  existence.  An  example  is  seen  in  the  Mundaka  Upanisad\nII.II.VII. beginning yah sarvajnah sarvavid which states: The  Supreme  Lord\nis omniscient and omnipotent and His  glory  is  pervading  through  all  of\ncreation. He eternally  dwells  in  Vaikuntha  the  eternal,  transcendental\nspiritual worlds  and  simultaneously  with  the  heart  of  every  jiva  or\nembodied being. The term garbha means seed as in embryo in the form  of  all\nthe animate myriad trillions of atmas or immortal souls  manifesting  within\nthe jivas en masse at the time of their appearance.  So  in  the  inanimate,\nwomb like nature of prakriti the Supreme Lord casts  the  animate  seeds  in\naggregate corresponding precisely to the exact finite number  of  atmas  for\nevery jiva in creation. The purport is that  the  Supreme  Lord  impregnates\nmaterial nature with souls in the form of incalculable living  enities  that\nassume unlimited forms  throughout  material  existence.  The  ksetrajna  or\nknower of the field  of  activity  uniting  with  the  ksetra  or  field  of\nactivity.  Thus are  all  jivas  from  Brahma  down  to  a  one-cell  amoeba\nmanifested by the combination of the  aforementioned  principles;  generated\nby the will of the Supreme Lord. That such  manifestation  is  actually  and\nfactually from the Supreme Lord will be given next.\n\n",
  "14-22": "\n\n\n\n\nThe  word  prakasa  means  illumination,   lucidity,   the   brightness   of\ndisposition and are the effects of sattva guna or the mode of goodness.  The\nword pravritti means enthusiastic effort or  the  disposition  to  endeavour\nactively and are the effects of raja guna the  mode  of  passion.  The  word\nmoha means delusion, bewilderment or  having  a  distorted  perception.  All\nthings external to the atma or immortal soul are of two categories.  One  is\nwhat  causes  attraction  and  the  second  is  what  causes  aversion.  The\nfundamental symptom of discerning who is beyond the three gunas or modes  of\nmaterial nature is that such a being neither desire to accept  anything  nor\ndoes such a one  desire  to  reject  anything.  Whatever  the  Supreme  Lord\nKrishna designates to come, such a one remains equipoise in all  situations.\nSuch a one is udasinavat or unconcerned with external circumstances  because\nof being enraptured within by atma tattva or  realisation  of  the  immortal\nsoul. Therefore one is naturally indifferent to anything external.  One  who\nis never agitated by attraction and aversion  which  arise  from  the  three\ngunas and who lucid and tranquil reflects within that it is natural for  the\nimpulses of the three gunas  to  occasionally  parade  themselves  in  one's\nconsciousness, is never deluded by them into being impelled to  act  as  the\nqualities might provoke one to respond.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word sama means equanimity or keeping oneself equipoise in both joy  and\ndistress. The word  svasthah  means  solidly  situated,  established  firmly\nwithin on the immortal atma, filled with raptureand bliss by its  communion.\nSuch a one is never even distracted by external things let alone  influenced\nby them. Even when exposed to great events of joy or catastrophic events  of\ngrief such a one  is  undisturbes  and  does  not  succumb  to  delusion  or\nilllusion. To such a one a clod of earth or , a precious jewel or  a  nugget\nof gold all are looked upon alike as merely modifications  of  prakriti.  So\nthere is nothing in material existence which such  a  one  has  any  special\nattraction or aversion towards.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word means dhirah means sober and denotes  the  wisdom  of  one  who  is\nknowledgeable  of  the  distinction  between  prakriti   or   the   material\nsubstratum pervading physical existence and the  eternal  atma  or  immortal\nsoul. Hence such a one remains equaniminous in both praise and  censure.  It\nis the deisre for  praise  and  adulation  that  shows  the  consequence  of\negotism which abides in the mind and is erroneously mistaken  for  the  atma\nand deludes one into thinking that it  is  a  great  honor  to  be  praised.\nSimilarly aversion to being ridiculed and censured is also  the  consequence\nof same egotism which makes one think it is ignoble and shameful to  receive\nsuch infamy. But both conceptions are the results of delusion  and  one  who\nis established in atma tattva or realisation of the immortal soul  is  never\nimplicated in illusion  as  such  a  being  is  unlimited  in  consciousness\nknowing that all material designations  are  all  transcended  by  communion\nwith the atma. In the same way that egotism is alienated from the atma  what\npertains to egotism such as honor and disgrace, friends and enemies,  praise\nand censue does not affect the atma. One who is illuminated by  atma  tattva\nis unconcerned and indifferent to worldly matters. Similarly  since  such  a\none comprehends that all efforts of activity are the cause and  perpetuation\nof physical embodiment such a one abandons all efforts not  related  to  the\natma. Such a person is known to be a conqueror of  the  theree  gunas.  Next\nthe primary means to overcome them will be given.\n\n\n",
  "14-17": "\nWhat Lord Krishna is stating about those situated  in  sattva  guna  or  the\nmode of goodness increase their wisdom  to  fruition  then  atma  tattva  or\nrealisation of the immortal soul becomes a reality. When raja  guna  or  the\nmode of passion increases in intensity more  and  more  avid  appetites  are\nincited to enjoy the fruits of. Similarly when tama  guna  or  the  mode  of\nignorance  increases  it  manifests  as  perverted  understanding  and   the\nproclivity to be influenced by wickedness from which more and more  tama  is\nbegotten. Thus all developement of intelligence is blocked and neutralised.\n\n",

Lord  Krishna\nconfirms that this is indicative that sattva guna or the  mode  of  goodness\nis predominant.\n\n\n",
  "14-10": "\n\n\n\nLord Krishna confirms the fact that the three gunas or modes  of  sattva  or\ngoodness, rajas or passion and tamas or nescience are  the  three  qualities\nthat exist within all jivas or embodied beings in  the  material  existence.\nBut owing to adrishta which is conditions imposed by  the  effects  of  past\nkarma or reactions to actions and determined as well by the  types  of  food\nthat were chosen to eat in sustaining the  physical  body  in  the  previous\nlife. Based upon this assessment any of three gunas may be dominant or  they\nmay neutralise each  other  or  they  may  be  antagonistic  to  each  other\ndepending upon which mode is more present and dominant within a  jiva.  This\nbeing the  reality  it  can  be  inferred  by  knowledge  and  discerned  by\nwitnessing the visible effects of the three gunas as manifested  within  any\njiva.\n\n",
  "14-1": "\nIn  the  previous  chapter  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  explained  that  by\ncomprehending the factual relationships of purusa or the  Supreme  Being  as\nparamatma the all pervading supreme soul, the  atma  or  the  immortal  soul\nand prakriti or the material substratum pervading physical existence.

By  doing  so  one\nwould achieve  moksa or freedom from material existence.\n\nNow in this chapter the Lord Krishna propounds how the gunas or three  modes\nof sattva guna or mode of goodness, raja guna or mode of  passion  and  tama\nguna or mode of ignorance all individually and conjointly cause the jiva  or\nembodied being to be bound to samsara  the  perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and\ndeath and gives the remedy by  which  one  may  be  redeemed  and  delivered\ntherefrom. The word  pravaksyami  means  I  will  declare.  What  will  Lord\nKrishna declare?  He  will  declare  jnananam  jnanam  uttamam  meaning  the\ntopmost knowledge and wisdom. What knowledge and wisdom is  this?  Knowledge\nof  the three gunas whose qualities directly influence  the  combination  of\nprakriti and purusa effected as the jiva or embodied being. What  wisdom  is\nthis? Wisdom that surpasses all that has previously  been  told  about  this\ncombination. The munis  are  the  great  sages  and  seers  or  munayah  who\npossessing this wisdom  in  deep  meditation  achieve  self-realisation  and\nrelease from samsara ascending to the supreme state. The excellence of  this\nwisdom is extolled next.\n\n",

For  can  one  surmount  the\nthree gunas by mere reflection and contemplation which is always  liable  to\nbe violated by the obstacles of old habits inimical  to  them  by  the  mind\nwhich has been contracted out in service to them for countless lifetimes.\n\nMam=unto Me the infallibly willed,  the  infinitely  loving,  the  ocean  of\nmercy to His devotees.\nAvyabhicharena  means  without  adulteration,  interruption  or   error   in\nexclusive devotion\nBhakti yoga means communion with the Supreme  Lord  through  intense  loving\nemotions\nOnly the devotee of bhakti yoga will be  able  to  surmount  the  gunas  and\nattain Lord Krishna\nBrahma bhuyaya  =  Brahma  bhavaya  or  eligibility  and  qualification  for\nrealisingthe brahman\nThe brahman is the spiritual substratum pervading  all  existence.  Although\nit is eternal and imperishable it is  only  the  impersonal  aspect  of  the\nSupreme Lord Krishna manifesting from  the  effulgence  emanating  from  His\ninconceivable spiritual form. It also contains elements  of  the  nature  of\nthe  atma  or  the  localised  immortal  soul  as  well  as  paramatma   the\nomnipresent Supreme Soul within the etheric heart of all sentient beings  in\nall dimensions and manifestations of creation in existence.\n\n",

Then all traces  and  residue  of  raja  guna  or  mode  of\npassion and tama guna or mode of ignorance will be completely dissolved  and\neradicated. When the aspirant becomes knowledgeable  in  the  mechanisms  of\nthe three gunas or modes of material nature and realises that they  actually\nare  performing  all  actions  themselves  according  to  their   respective\nqualities,then they see that they are not the doer but  only  the  observer.\nWhen such a one further  perceives  the  localised  atma  or  immortal  soul\nwithin the etheric heart as being eternally  a  part  of  paramatma  or  the\nSupreme Soul within the etheric heart of all sentient beings  everywhere  in\ncreation; then one attains a state of consciousness like  unto  the  Supreme\nLord. The understanding is that the atma or immortal  soul  is  eternal  and\ntranscendental to all aspects of material nature  and  thus  free  from  any\ninfluence or karma or reactions to actions that may  come  to  the  jiva  or\nembodied being due to its association with the three gunas  within  material\nexistence.  The  atma  itself  is  of  the  nature  of  infinite   expanding\nconsciousness.

The  heart  is  the\nexclusive, absolute center from where  all  consciousness  radiates.  It  is\nalso the factual center from where all impulses  and  frequencies  originate\nboth  active  and  passive.  The  Brihadaranya  Upanisad  V.VI.I   beginning\nmanomayo ayam puruso states: One meditating should perceive the  resplendent\nSupreme Lord the  ruler and lord of all within the heart of the  size  of  a\ngrain of rice.

Intuitive knowledge  related  exclusively  to\nthe authority of the Vedic  scriptures  and  meditation  which  expands  the\nconsciousness. Contrarily also from the Supreme Lord  comes  the  antithesis\nof the above which are loss  of  memory,  speculative  reasoning,  erroneous\nhypothesis, conjectural suppositions and deprivation of consciousness.\n\n\nThe Supreme Lord is to be known by the  exclusive  authority  of  the  Vedic\nscriptures. He is the atma within all jivas, the witness, the  monitor,  the\ninner guide.  The terms found in the Vedas of demigod, humans, demons,  etc.\nare alluding to the jivatma or individual immortal soul  within  the  myriad\nof varieagated forms of  embodied  beings.  The  compound  word  vedanta-krt\nrefers directly to Lord Krishna's avatara or incarnation  of  Vedavyasa  who\ncompiled the Vedas and divided them into four  divisions.  It  also  denotes\nthe performance of  Vedic enjoined rituals. The  antonym  antah  also  means\nthe end which infers the fruits, the results of  such  rituals.  He  is  the\nsole bequeather of all the fruits promised in  the  Vedic  scriptures.

He is also the supreme knower of  the  Vedic  scriptures\nfor  they  originated  from   Him   to   guide   and   teach   jivas   about\nHimself. Whosoever understands the Vedic scriptures otherwise then what  has\nbeen instructed by Lord Krishna in Srimad  Bhagavad-Gita  factually  has  no\nknowledge  of  it  at  all.

This  supreme  soul  is   designated   as\nparamatma in all the Vedic scriptures. The very epithet  of  parama  meaning\nexaltedly supreme reveals that paramatma is distinctly unique and  different\nfrom even the atma or immortal soul. All the atmas collectively  in  all  of\ncreation comprise the spiritual  form  of  paramatma  which  penetrates  all\ncreation sustaining and maintaining  it.  The  word  loka  means  world  and\nbecause it is written as lokyate it refers to the three  classifications  of\nworlds. One of them  is  achetana  the  inanimate  worlds.  Two  is  buddha-\nchetana  or the animate worlds mixed with the  inanimate  worlds.  Three  is\nthe unlimited and eternally liberated spiritual worlds. It  is  these  three\ncategories of worlds and all the jivas or embodied  beings  upon  them  that\nthe Supreme Lord Krishna pervades and permeates, maintains and  sustains  by\nthe fact that all the  worlds  are  originally  generated  by  Him.  As  the\nsoveriegn creator of all creation this makes Him distinctly  different  from\neverything else yet at the same time a part  of  it.  Because  He  alone  is\ninfinite it can be comprehended that only He  can  be  distinctly  different\nfrom the finite consisting of the  inanimate,  the  animate,  the  jivas  in\nbondage and those who have achieved liberation.\n\n",
  "15-13": "\nLord Krishna declares that He is vaisvanara the digestive fire  which  joins\ntogether with the vital  breaths  of   prana  or  exhalation  and  apana  or\ninhalation. Together they digest in the  stomach  the  four  kinds  of  food\nwhich are foods that are khadva  or  chewed,  soshva  or  sucked,  lehya  or\nlicked and peya or drank.  In  these  last  three  verses  Lord  Krishna  is\nspecifying integral functions of the jivas or embodied  beings  and  of  the\nEarth that are manifestations of His opulent glories. The  expressions  that\nHe becomes the light of  the  sun, moon and fire etc. are meant to  indicate\nthe predicated relationship that theses object have in regard to  Him.  That\nfact  that  such  realtionships  exist  in  reference  to  all   things   is\nsubstantiated in the next verse.\n\n",

By cultivating this path they purify  their  minds\nand hearts by yoga or the individual consciousness attaining communion  with\nthe ultimate consciousness.  They  then  realise  the  true  nature  of  the\natma residing within the etheric heart of the physical body and perceive  it\ndistinctly  different  from  the  body.  But  if  their  efforts  even  if\nindustrous are devoid of sufficient faith in  the  spiritual  preceptor  and\nunalloyed devotion to the Supreme Lord and  thus  spiritually  impotent  and\nfeeble minded, then they are handicapped and incapable  of  atma  tattva  or\nrealisation of the soul. Hence they do not perceive it. Although  the  light\nof the sun, the moon, lightning and fire are powerful antidotes to  removing\ndarkness, they are limited to removing only external darkness and they  have\nthis power due to their empowerment  by  the  divine  consciousness  of  the\nSupreme Lord which has the capacity to remove the darkness of  ignorance  in\nthe phenomenal world externally and the darkness  of  ignorance  within  the\nconsciousness of the jiva internally.\n\n",

That  which  is\ndesignated as a jiva or embodied being is known as perishahable, from  Bahma\nto a blade of grass all are subject to limited  transitory  existences.  The\nsingular form of the word atma or immortal soul denotes the totality of  all\njivas as a category inasmuch as they all possess the atma and are all  bound\nto material  nature.  The  word  aksarah  meaning  infallible,  imperishable\nrefers to the freed jiva who is  situated  in  its  own  eternal,  essential\nnature  and  not  bound  by  material  nature.  The  word  kutasthah   means\nimmutable, constant in regard  to  its  lack  of  associaion  with  material\nnature having no connection to the physical plane. The singular use of  this\nword denotes all jivas collectively who are liberated from material  nature.\nIt should be understood that such jivas are innumerable as Lord Krishna  has\nrevealed previously in chapter 4, verse 10 that  many  purifying  themselves\nby knowledge and meditation have achieved the supreme, liberated state.\n\n\n",

As  His  transcendntal\nspiritual body consists of the atmas of all jivas or  embodied  beings,  He,\nHis name, His abode and His pastimes are all illuminating. No  sun  or  moon\nor fire can illuminate this; for it  is  spiritual  wisdom  that  gives  the\nlight of consciousness. External luminiousity is only able to  dissolve  the\nobscurity that intervenes between the senses perceiving  their  objects.What\nreveals the atma is called yoga or  the  individual  conciousness  attaining\ncommunion with the ultimate consciousness. Antagonistic  to  yoga  is  karma\nwhich are subsequent  reactions to previous  actions  and  to  conquer  this\nformidable opponent which gains strength from every  action  performed;  one\nmust fully surrender unto the Supreme Lord and  accept  Him  as  one's  only\nrefuge. That all illuminating light emanates from Him, it is a part  of  His\nsplendour  as  a  power  from  Him.  The  sublime  supremacy  of  this   all\nilluminating light consists of its potency and efficiency  in  lighting  the\nconsciousness by spiritual wisdom. Sunlight no matter how  bright,  although\ncapable of travelling for millions and billions of miles  through  space  is\nnever able to internally effect illumination in the consciousness as  it  is\nonly an external phenomena.\n\n",

Precisely based on this karma a jiva is forced to accept  a  suitable\nbody such as a demigod, human, animal etc., attracting with it  five  senses\nand a mind exactly appropriate to maximising the  chances  of  survival  for\nsuch a  jiva.  But  when  the  jiva  through  association  of  the  Vaisnava\nspiritual  master  becomes  enlightened   from   hearing   his   unequivocal\ninstructions and surrenders fully unto the Supreme  Lord  Krishna  as  one's\nonly refuge then Lord Krishna Himself releases the jiva from the bondage  of\nsamsara and the jiva becomes situated in atma-tattva  or  soul  realisation.\nOther  than  taking  exclusive  shelter  of  Lord  Krishna  or  any  of  His\nauthorised incarnations as revealed in Vedic sciptures it is impossible  for\nthe jiva which is  very  much  handicapped  in  terms  of  intelligence  and\npotency to achieve moksa or liberation. This is due to the heavy  burden  of\nunresolved karma attached to the jiva that they must carry  with  them  life\nafter life. But all actions performed for the satisfaction  of  the  Supreme\nLord have no karma attached to them. This is the difference.\n\n",

I am great, etc., etc. Such I am conceptions keeps one locked  in\nsamsara and causes one to  be  fully  occupied  with  mundane  concerns  and\nworldly affairs appropriate to such  conceptions.  Such  persons  look  upon\ntheir bodily conceptions as there very self  and  are  completely  oblivious\nthat they are factually eternal beings possessing an atma or immortal  soul.\nThey perceive not that they can gradually wean themselves from this  ancient\ntree by renuciation of the three gunas  or  modes  of  material  nature  and\ndetachment from the objects of the senses. Neither do they  comprehend  that\nthe atma is seperate and distinct from  the  physical  body.  Nor  can  they\ndifferentiate that the ego is not the physical body and the atma is not  the\nego. Bewildered by illusion they believe what is unreal to be real and  what\nis real they cannot perceive. The origin and source is unfathomable to  them\nand so deluded they remain in ignorance.\n\nThis asvattha tree with roots above and branches below that keeps  the  jiva\nenslaved in samsara can only be destroyed by the sword of non-attachment  to\nobjects of the senses. This renunciation arises  from  bhakti  or  exclusive\nloving devotion to the Supreme Lord Krishna which is the  highest  good  and\napex of all to be attained by every  jivas  and  paramount  to  every  other\nconceivable activity in existence throughout all  of  creation.  Demolishing\nthis strong and durable asvattha tree by  the  sharp  weapon  of  detachment\nfrom sense objects produces  disike  and  disdain  for  sense  gratification\nwhich creates a desire for pure, sublime spiritual  experiences  which  when\none attains can no longer be subjected to the influence of the  three  gunas\nor  modes of  material  nature.  How  can  such  a  state  of  consciousness\nmanifest and detachment from the gunas which causes delusion be  guaranteed?\n\n\nLord Krishna has already  previously  confirmed  in  chapter  VII.VII:  That\nthere is nothing superior  to  Him.  In  chapter  VII.XIV:  That  those  who\nsurrender unto Him alone can surmount the three gunas.  In  chapter  IX,  X:\nThat material nature is operating under His control. In X.VIII: That  He  is\nthe origin and source of all material and spiritual worlds. So let  glorious\npropitiation and  devotion be given unto the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  as  He\nalone is the sole refuge of all living entities. Inasmuch  as  all  material\nimpressions, instincts and influences arise  from  contact  with  the  three\ngunas proceeding from prakriti the material  substratum  pervading  physical\nexistence which is controlled byHim. It is logical  to  understand  that  by\nHim they can also be transcended. The question that naturally comes to  mind\nis  how?  The  word  prapadye  means  surrender.  In   VII.XIV   is   stated\nprapadyante or have surrendered. In  this  verse  a  variant  is  stated  as\nprapadye yatah which by the gramatical rules of Panini  can  be  interpreted\nas prapadye  iyatah  meaning  by  a  mere  step  of  surrendering  unto  Him\nspiritual impressions, instincts and influences are activated and awaken  in\nsuch a one.  They  will  manifest  as  spontaneous  impulses  arising   with\nfrequency in the heart and dispel all nescience. They  are  ancient  because\nthey embody the collective consciousness of all the mumukshas  or  achievers\nof moksa or liberation from material existence since  time  immemorial,  who\nsurrendered and took refuge of the Supreme Lord Krishna  or  His  authorised\nincarnation and expansion as revealed in Vedic scriptures and were  released\nforever from the bondage of samsara.\n\n",

Creation is constituted  by  kshara  or  transient\nsouls in bondage and aksara or eternally liberated souls.  Both  kshara  and\nakshara  constitute  His  spiritual  form  which  constitutes   the   cosmic\nmanifestation but He is inconceivably distinctly different  from  both.  The\nSupreme Lord being the Supreme creator and controller of all, the source  of\nall  glorious  attributes  and  wonderful  qualities  is   a   fountain   of\nrighteousness and the antithesis of all that is evil and demoniac.  For  the\nelucidation of this eternal truth the Supreme Lord  cites  the  Asvattha  or\nbanyan tree as a metaphor to  symbolise  the  material  manifestation  as  a\nplace of bondage and enslavement for the atmas or immortal souls trapped  as\na jiva in samsara or the perpetual cycle of  birth  and  death.  How  kshara\nsouls may escape from samsara and become the akshara souls is  His  glorious\nplan of evolution and  it  is  enacted  by  the  sword  of  knowledge  which\ndestroys the tree of materialism by the weapon of non-attachment.\n\nThe state of samsara is symbolised by the asvattha or banyan tree  which  in\nreal ilfe has its roots growing upwards and its branches growing  downwards.\nThe indestructible nature of  samsara is symbolised in the  second  division\nof  the Katha Upanisad III.I beginning urdhva mulo avak shakha which  means:\nWith  roots  upwards  and  branches  downwards   this   primeval   tree   is\neverlasting. With roots upwards refers to our Brahma with  four  faces,  the\nsecondary creator who is situated above the seven worlds  of  Bhur,  Bhuvah,\nSvah, Mahah, etc.. The branches downwards  refer  to  all  the  denziens  of\ncreation in the form of humans, animals, birds, fish, plants, insects,  etc.\nThe indestructible nature of this tree  is  due  to  its  being  avyayan  or\neverlasting like a river with no end and because as a tree it is  impossible\nto  uproot until  one  is  weaned  from  sense  gratification  and  material\ndesires by the mercy of  the  Supreme  Lords  devotee  and  atma  tattva  is\nachieved by His His grace. The word chandamsi   refers  to  the  injunctions\nand prohibitions of the Vedic scriptures which are symbolised by the  leaves\nwhich flourish or dwindle in proportion to the karma  or  reactions  to  the\nactions one accrues by adhering to or ignoring such provisions.  Leaves  are\nvery  instrumental  in  preserving  the  longevity  of  trees.  Whoever   is\nknowledgeable  of  this  tree  as  just  explained  comprehends  the   Vedic\nscriptures as the knowledge of non-attachment  is  the  ways  and  means  of\nuprooting this tree and allows one to achieve atma tattva.\n\n",

The  word  manoratham  means  desirable  object  and\nwhatever is  desirable  the  demoniac  feel  it  is  their  right  to  enjoy\nregardless of morality. The wealth that they gain by  any  means  lawful  or\nunlawful, or by cheating and stealing they see as moral and rightful  as  it\nwas gained by their own brain and brawn over others  brain  and  brawn.  The\ndemoniac follow the idea that might is right  and  do  not  believe  in  any\nsubjective force or higher power. They forcefully take whatever they  desire\nand are totally unconcerned of  any  consequences,  oblivious  to  even  the\npossibility that a god or supreme force sanctioning their  endeavours  could\nexist. The demoniac feel that they are so powerful that they themselves  are\ngods because they can destroy their enemies as a whim and consider  everyone\nexcept themselves to be of unimportance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe demoniac think like the following examples illustrate.  I  am  the  most\npowerful. I was born into a dynasty of aristocracy and wealth. Who  else  in\nthis world is equal to  me?  Who  else  by  dint  of  their  exertions  have\nacquired every pleasure there is to enjoy and secured so much happiness  and\nstability? I will eat, drink and be merry, enjoying sense  gratification  to\nthe maximum without restraint. There is no need for me  to  believe  in  any\ngod or supreme power; but anyway I will  perform  some  pseudo  rituals  and\nimitate some pious activities by ostentatious donations for charity to  gain\nrenown so others will think that I am also a great religious personality  as\nwell. This is how the demoniac think.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe demoniac see themselves  as  the  enjoyers,  the  manipulators  and  the\ncontrollers, The demoniac believe that they are all  powerful,  independent,\nmasters of their own destines and independent  of  any  supreme  and  unseen\npower; but so deluded are they that they completely ignore the reality  that\ndeath  will  come  and  indiscriminately  abduct   them   from   all   their\npossessions.

This  also  applies  to  His\nauthorised incarnations and expansions.\n7) svadhyayah is devoted study of Vedic  scriptures,  knowing  that  they\nalone teach the glories of the Supreme Lord and are  the  quintessence\nof all that is spiritual.\n8) tapas is austerity and penance. Performing expiatory activities  is  a\nduty for all human beings such as Ekadasi which is  mandatory  fasting\nfrom all grains on the 11th day of the waxing  and  waning  moons.  As\nwell there are occasional  expiatory  activities  such  as  candrayana\nwhich are fasts synchronised with the cycles  of  the  moon  and  also\nkricchra which is extreme ascetic penance performed under very hot  or\nvery cold conditions and prajapatya  and  santapana.

The\nword sraddhamayo means inundated with  one  of  the  three  types  of  faith\nsituated from either sattva guna the mode of goodness, raja  guna  the  mode\nof passion or tama guna the mode of ignorance. In  whatever  mode  of  faith\none is united with into that mode of faith one is  transformed.  If  such  a\njiva is imbued with faith  for  performing  spiritual  activities  one  will\nachieve spiritual results. Contrarily if one  is  attracted  with  faith  to\nperform demoniac activities  one  will  achieve  demoniac  results  both  in\naccordance with their faith.\n\n",

Such  indiscriminate  jivas  or\nembodied beings torture and afflict their own body and the bodies of  others\nin the  pursuit  of  fulfilling  their  depraved  and  macabre  rituals  for\ndominion over  material  existence.  The  words  raga  balanvitah  means  by\nostentatious displays of mental control and bodily power  in  such  extremes\nthat even the Supreme Lord feels tormented in His all pervasive form as  the\natma or immortal soul within all living  entities.  The  words  mam  eva  ca\nrefers specifically to His inner presence. Hence whosoever executes  rituals\nthat are contrary to the ordinances and injunctions of the Vedic  scriptures\nand engages in sacrifices that are prohibited in the  Vedic  scriptures,  or\npractices penances which cause great pain and suffering upon themselves  and\nothers, molest the very elements contained within the body  for its  welfare\nto be abused and the atma to be disrespected  are  verily  to  be  known  as\npossessing the demoniac nature. The demoniac transgress the  ordinances  and\ninjunctions of the Vedic scriptures and are  known  as  asuras  which  means\nwithout light denoting without the light of  divine  consciousness.  Due  to\ntheir bellicose and belligerent disposition of opposing  the  Supreme  Lords\ncommands, the demoniac purposely act contrary in defiance. Because  of  this\nthey are unable to derive even the most miniscule satisfaction  and  lasting\nhappiness for their immense efforts.  All they derive  from  their  scheming\nconjures of evil actions is accommodation in the hellish planets  direct  at\nthe conclusion of their life  cycle.  By  their  own  demoniac  actions  and\nsinful activities they have voluntarily hurled themselves into such  a  dire\npredicament without relief.\n\nNext  Lord  Krishna  will  explain  how  natures  differ  according  to  the\nqualities of the three gunas or modes of material  nature  that  a  jiva  is\nsituated in and influenced by. As the three gunas are directly  affected  by\nthe food a jiva chooses to eat and helps determine their present birth.  The\nthreefold nature of foods as they are situated in one of the three gunas  of\nsattva guna, raja guna and tama guna corresponding to the mode of  goodness,\nthe mode of passion and the mode of ignorance will be described first.  This\nis confirmed in the  Chandogya  Upanisad  VI.V.IV  beginning  anna-mayam  hi\nsommya manah it states:  The mind is verily composed of  the  food  that  is\neaten is further confirmed in  verse  VII.XXVI.II  beginning  rahara  shudda\nsattva shuddhi which states: Taking pure food in pure  condition  after  its\nbeen first offered to the Supreme Lord. As the purity of the food  eaten  so\nis the purity of the mind for pure food enhances the mind with purity.\n\n",
  "17-23": "\n\nThe Supreme  Lord  Krishna  explains  that  the  word  SAT  denotes  eternal\nexistence and perpetual goodness. The words  sad-bhave  exemplifies  eternal\nexistence and the words sadhu-bhave exemplifies  perpetual  goodness.   This\nis the correct understanding in which SAT  is  to  be  comprehended  in  the\nVedas as well as its utilisation by the  recitation  of  SAT  in  prescribed\nVedic  rituals  performed  exclusively  by  the  Vaisnavas  and   brahmanas.\nSimilarly the transcendental sound of SAT may be evoked for  any  auspicious\nactivity ordained  by  the  Vedic  scriptures  by  duly  initiated  Vaisnava\nbrahmanas in  any  of  the  480,000  types  of  humans  existing  throughout\ncreation.\n\nTo follow the prescribed Vedic duties of yagna or propitiation  and  worship\nby the Vaisnava brahmanas, tapah or austerities by the ksatriyas  the  royal\nwarrior class and danam or charity by the vaisyas or merchant class are  all\nconsiderd  in  sattva  guna  or  mode   of   goodness   because   they   are\nconscientiously following  the  ordinances  and  injunctions  of  the  Vedic\nscriptures. Thus all such activities are known  as  SAT  denoting  perpetual\ngoodness and due to  being  dedicated  to  the  Supreme  Lord  they  possess\nauspicious attributes of an eternal nature and for this they are also  known\nas SAT.\n\nThus the relationship of OM  TAT  SAT  to  the  Vedas,  the  performance  of\nprescribed Vedic activities performed by Vaisnava  brahmanas  and  protected\nby the ksatriyas while supported  by  the  vaisyas  clearly  and  succinctly\ndemonstrates what is  factually  Vedic  in  society  and  what  is  actually\nsituated in sattva guna while simultaneously clarifying  comprehensively  by\nthe logic of opposing parallels what  is  not  Vedic  in  society  and  thus\ndoomed to the perdition of exclusion from  the  ascending  orbit  of  sattva\nguna.\n\n",
  "17-20": "\n\n\n\n\nUp until this  time  Lord  Krishna  has  elaborated  upon  the  distinctions\nbetween yagna or propitiation, tapah or austerities and dana or charity  and\nhow they are categorised in the three gunas or  modes  of  material  nature.\nNow the Supreme Lord will  illustrate  how  yagna,  tapah  and  dana  become\nspiritualised by being unified with the pranava OM. The term pranava  refers\nto first breath which is first vibrated as OM commencing  all  Vedic  rites.\nIt is derived from the root  word  prana  meaning  breath  and  is  properly\npronounced AAH with mouth open OOH with lips puckered and  MMMM  by  pursing\nthem together.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe triplicate formula OM TAT SAT is used in reference  to  the  brahman  or\nspiritual substratum pervading all existence which is the impersonal  aspect\nof the Supreme Lord. The  brahman  also  refers  to  the  Vedas  which  also\noriginally  emanated  from  the  Supreme  Lords  prana.  The  Vedas   denote\nVedically ordained activities of which yagna, tapah and dana are  essential.\nAll Vedically ordained yagnas, rituals and ceremonies are only bonafide  and\nvalid if prefaced with the pranava OM at  its  commencement  accompanied  by\nits auxiliaries TAT and SAT. The absence of the transcendental sound  of  OM\nvibrating from the  very  inception  of  any  Vedic  activity  automatically\ndisqualifies it and renders  it  invalid  even  if  subsequent  rituals  are\nperformed  perfect  and  perfunctory.  The  pranava   OM   is   an   eternal\nprerequisite for every expiatory rite prescribed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures\nand  thus  indispensable.  The  pranava  OM  is  the  transcendental   sound\nvibration personally representing the Supreme Lord  Krishna.  The  auxiliary\nTAT denotes complete perfection and auspiciousness  and  the  auxiliary  SAT\ndenotes the source of all creation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vaisnavas and the brahmanas are  those  who  have  the  sole  right  and\nexclusive  authority  to  vibrate  these  transcendental  sound   vibrations\naudibly  and  inaudibly  during  all  rituals  prescribed   in   the   Vedic\nscriptures. Brahmanas are those seminally  born  in  India  in  the  topmost\ncaste of Brahmin families.  Vaisnavas  are  devotees  of  the  Supreme  Lord\nKrishna or any of His authorised incarnations and expansions as revealed  in\nVedic scriptures, who are  born  in  any  caste,  in  any  country,  in  any\nplanetary system and who are so attracted to the Supreme Lord  Krishna  that\nthey make themselves available to  receive  twice  born  Brahmin  initiation\nfrom a Vaisnava acarya or bonafide spiritual master from  one  of  the  four\nauthorised sampradaya or bonafide  channel  of  disciplic  succession.  Only\nduly initiated Vaisnavas and Brahmins are ordained to perform  Vedic  rites,\nno others have this authority and in this matter there is no exception.  The\nBrahmins and the Vaisnavas were  originally  created  by  the  Supreme  Lord\nalong with the Vedas and yagnas  to  harmoniously  evolve  and  perfect  all\ncreation.\n\n\n",
  "17-1": "\nIn chapter sixteen  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  delineated  the  difference\nbetween those endowed with  the  divine  nature  and  those  possessing  the\ndemoniac nature. The conclusion of that chapter is that the  absolute  truth\nand highest benefit for all creation as  well  as  the  means  by  which  to\nattain communion with the ultimate reality of  the  Supreme  Lord  is  based\nexclusively on the authority of the Vedic scriptures and no other source.\n\nIn this  chapter  it  will  be  illustrated  that  activities  performed  in\ncontradiction to the Vedic scriptures actually oppose  the  divine  will  of\ncreation and  prove  to  be  destabilising  and  destructive.  The  question\ninvolved is  not  concerned  with  contradictory  activities.  The  question\nrefers to religious activities performed  not  contradictory  to  the  Vedic\nscriptures whether in sattva guna the mode of goodness, raja guna  the  mode\nof passion or tama guna the mode of ignorance corresponding  to  the  intent\nand motive and if they are performed with faith what is  the  difference  in\nresults. If one is indifferent or not knowledgeable about  the  veracity  of\nthe paramount position of the Vedic scriptures  and  performs  instead  with\nfaith the traditional rituals that one was born into, does that   constitute\nsattva guna, raja guna or tama guna and what are the results.\n\nQuestioned in this manner Lord Krishna  refrains  from  speaking  about  the\nutter futility of performing any activity contrary to Vedic scriptures  even\nwith faith and immediately expounds  upon  the  relationship  of  the  three\ngunas or modes of material nature.\n\n",
  "17-2": "\n\n\n\nThe gunas or three modes of material nature are  sattva  guna  the  mode  of\ngoodnes, raja guna the mode of passion and tama guna the mode of  ignorance.\nThey are singularly inherent within  the  faith  of  all  mankind  and  they\nconform to the characteristics and disposition particular to  each  jiva  or\nembodied being.  The  impressions  from  past  life  incarnations  arise  as\ntendencies pursued in a present life correspondent to one's mood  and  taste\nand from that mood and taste ones' faith arises. Displays of enthusiasm  are\nindications of faith where underlying is the belief that the effort will  be\nsuccessfully fulfilled. Tendency, taste and faith  are  actually  properties\nof the atma or immortal soul;  but  they  are  only  evoked  when  the  atma\nhappens by chance to come in contact with the gunas.  It  has  been  deduced\nthat when there is tranquillity in the mind there is control of  the  senses\nand peacefulness of the body and such effect manifests  the  chance  contact\nbetween the atma and the gunas resulting in sattva guna.  Agitation  of  the\nmind, unbridled senses and over indulgence of the body results in  raja  and\ntama guna. Thus  effectively the experiences from past lives  manifest  into\none of the three gunas. \n\n",

Such foods promote  long  life,  invigorating  the\nbody and elevating  the  mind  in  its  function  of  intelligence.  As  was\nconfirmed earlier in chapter XIV verse XVII:  From  the  quality  of  sattva\nguna knowledge arises.  Sattva  guna  facilitates  spiritual  knowledge  and\nlikewise food that is sattva  also  facilitates  spiritual  intelligence  as\nwell as good health, strength, happiness and relish. The word sukla  meaning\nhappiness refers to the pleasure experienced while ingesting  the  food  and\nafterwards when it is digesting and assimilating within the body.  The  word\npriti means satisfaction that is derived  from  the  intake  of  pure  foods\ninspiring congenial interest  in  spiritual  activities.  The  word  rasayam\nmeans succulent, delectable. Snigdhah means  oleaginous,  unctuous.  Sthirah\nmeans nourishing, sustaining. Hrydha means agreeable,  pleasing.  These  are\nthe qualities of sattva foods which are very much appreciated  by  those  in\nsattva guna.  \n\nFoods that are acidic, bitter, salty, sour, spicy,  pungent,  dry,  hard  or\nburning are the foods that those in raja guna are very  much  attracted  to.\nThe word tiksna refers to food of no value because they are either  to  cold\nor to hot. Raksa are foods which are to dry and hard. Vidhahinah  are  those\nfoods that cause a burning sensation in the body. These foods produce  pain,\ndistress, sickness and misery and decreases longevity of life  and  increase\ndesires for more and more rajas or passion.\n\nThe foods liked by those in tama guna the mode of ignorance  are  yata-yaman\nmeaning stale, foods that are old from the previous day, foods  cooked  more\nthan a yama which is literally three hours before.  Gata-rasam  means  those\nfoods which have lost their original  flavour  and  have  become  tasteless.\nPuti means putrid, possessing a foul  smell.  Paryusitam  means  decomposed,\nunrecognisable. Ucchistam means eating the  remains  of  others  food  after\nthey  have  eaten.  This  does  not  apply  to  honouring  the  remnants  of\nmahaprasadam or sanctified food first  offered  to  Lord  Krishna  and  then\neaten by the spiritual preceptors  who  mercifully  leaves  some  for  their\ndevotees which is then glorified by  them  as  maha  mahaprasadam.  Amedhyam\nmeans unsanctified foods  due  to  not  having  been  consecrated  by  first\noffering it to the Supreme Lord and thus impure. Partaking of foods in  tama\nguna such as meat,  fish,  fowl,  eggs,  wine,  alcohol,  etc.  breeds  dark\nnescience and great ignorance.\n\nSo in conclusion those fortunate jivas or  embodied  beings  with  spiritual\ninsight should absolve themselves from the intake  of  foods  in  raja  guna\nand tama guna and resort exclusively to foods in sattva guna.\n\n",

These  results\nonly bind those who have not renounced the  desire  for  rewards  for  their\nactions expecting renumeration.  The  three  types  of  renunciation  to  be\nabandoned are: the rewards of the actions, the  attachment  to  the  actions\nfor the reward and the sense of authorship as the doer. If these  three  are\nrelinquished then there is no bondage to any action. The word  preyta  means\nafter death when in the next life the appropriate  rewards  will  be  reaped\nbut it does not preclude  that  some  results  cannot  be  experienced  even\nbefore death such as having  a  son  or  being  exposed  and  that  as  such\nrenunciation may still be applied even while receiving the results in  life.\nBut the emphasis is on renouncing the desires to receive rewards  for  one's\nactions. Anyway even if there is some desire for rewards  one  should  never\nunder  any  circumstances  peform  any  activity  inimical  to   the   Vedic\nscriptures, the Supreme Lord Krishna or His devotees the Vaisnavas.\n\nIt is undeniably true that prescribed Vedic activities  are  obligatory  for\neveryone according to varnasrama  or  rank  and  status  in  life.  This  is\nconfirmed by the fact that one is born automatically in  a  certain  family,\nin a  certain  society,  country,  continent,  planet,  etc.  based  on  the\nhankering for rewards in the previous life by which karma  or  reactions  to\nactions were incurred awarding the results of one's  past  life  activities.\nYet the  very  same  prescribed  activities  performed  without  desire  for\nrewards bestows completely different results. This  is  known  as  known  as\nviniyogah prithaktva nyaya and  is  the  justification  of  dispensation  by\nappropriate application. The aspirant for moksa or liberation from  material\nexistence who does not desire any rewards  is  awarded  something  different\nthen the furtive hankerer. As declared previously, by  study  of  the  Vedic\nscriptures, by yagna  or  ritual  propitiation  and  worship,  by  tapah  or\nausterities and by danam or charity the Vaisnava Brahmins  seek  to  commune\nwith the Supreme Lord.  Hence the sannyasa or renunciation that is  revealed\nin the Vedic scriptures is non-different from tyaja the renunciation of  the\ndesire for rewards, both which include absence of authorship and  ego  sense\nand no attachment. In this way prescribed Vedic  activities  and  obligatory\nactivities can be performed without reactions proving the reality  that  the\ncessation of all activity is not necessary neither is it  feasible  or  even\npractical.\n\nThe manner of divesting from oneself conceptions of authorship  thinking  of\noneself as the doer is to be situated in sattva guna the  mode  of  goodness\nand assign authorship of all actions which conform to Vedic scriptures  over\nto the Supreme Lord. From this correct determination arises the  feeling  of\nselflessness while performing actions and an absence of  desire  in  actions\nperformed. The Supreme Lord controls everything external through His  agency\nof prakriti or the material substratum pervading physical existence and  its\ntriplicate agency of the three gunas  or  modes  of  material  nature  which\nimpels all jivas or embodied beings to follow the impulses of the pranas  or\nlife airs and the natural propensities of the body they inhabit  based  upon\nkarma or reactions  to  actions  due  to  desire  for  rewards  in  previous\nlifetimes. Hence even the gratification of  the  senses  such  as  appeasing\none's appetites and all activities which natures  demands  necessitates  all\nbelong to the Supreme Lord and not the individual. Surrendering all  actions\nsolely unto the Supreme Lord  is  the  understanding  aspirants  are  imbued\nwith.\n\n",
  "18-3": "\nKapila Muni the  founder  of  the  Sankhya  philosophy  which  is  based  on\nanalytical reason declares that since even prescribed Vedic activities  have\nan aroma of desire for rewards attached to them and the resultant  reactions\nkeep one enslaved in samsara the perpetual  cycle  of  birth  and  death  in\nmaterial existence. So even  prescribed  Vedic  activities  are  fit  to  be\nabandoned by those aspirants striving for moksa or liberation from  material\nexistence.  But  those  of  the   Mimamsaka   philosophy   who   adhere   to\nrationalistic  thinking  in  interpreting  the  conclusions  of  the   Vedic\nscriptures maintain that prescribed Vedic duties are  not  to  be  abandoned\nonly the desires for rewards from such duties are in fact to be renounced.\n\n",
  "18-26": "Kumara Vaisnava Sampradaya:",
  "18-10": "\nThe aspirant who renounces both the desire for rewards as well as  any  ego-\nsense as the  doer is fully in sattva guna the mode  of  goodness.  Situated\nin correct knowledge and hence free from all doubts such a  one  is  neither\nbesieged by unrighteous acts nor relieved  from  righteous  acts.  Righteous\nacts are those that bestow positive reactions such as progeny,  cows,  entry\ninto the heavenly planets, etc. An unrighteous act is  that  which  one  may\naccidentally or unintentionally commit that will accrue  negative  reactions\nsuch as misery, pain, entry to the hellish planets, etc. It  should  not  be\nmisconstrued that final emancipation  applies  to  anyone  who  deliberately\nengages  in  unrighteous  activities  for  the  Katha   Upanisad   I,II.XXIV\nbeginning na virato duscharitanna shanto states: One who  has  not  desisted\nfrom evil unrighteous actions or who  is  of  unrestrained  mind  can  never\nachieve final emancipation even  if  one  is  a  paragon  of  intellect  and\nknowledge.\n\nIn as much as the ego-sense  is  absent  there  is  no  impetus  to  exhibit\naversion or attraction for either one or  the  other  and  since  all  other\ngoals have been relinquished and resigned with the  exception  of  moksa  or\nfinal emancipation from material existence and communion  with  the  Supreme\nLord Krishna or any of His authorised  incarnations  as  revealed  in  Vedic\nscriptures then one is truly established in ultimate renunciation. Thus  the\nconclusion is that relinquishing all ego-sense of authorship and  abandoning\nany desire for rewards is actual renunciation and not mere  abstention  from\nactions.\n\n",
  "18-30": "\nHere Lord Krishna explains that the buddhi or intellect  of  those  situated\nin raja guna the mode of passion are  unable  to  discern  between  the  two\ntypes of dharma or righteousness  given  in  the  previous  verse  or  their\nopposite of adharma or unrighteousness which subjects one  to  inappropriate\nactions according to time, place and circumstances.\n\n",
  "18-11": "\nIt should be clearly understood that whether confined to a physical body  or\na subtle body it is virtually impossible to  entirely  give  up  all  action\ncompletely.  In the physical body  the  heart  is  beating,  the  lungs  are\nbreathing, water must be drunk, some form of nourishment must  be  ingested.\nIf it is a subtle body then sunshine must be absorbed  or  prana  or  energy\nmust be assimilated. These things are indispensable for life in  a  physical\nor subtle body. Thus while residing in a physical  body  the  observance  of\nprescribed Vedic activities are essential and must be performed. It  is  the\nrenouncing  of  desires  for  the  rewards  of  actions  that   is   factual\nrenunciation and not the mere abandoning of  activities.  Such  renunciation\nalso includes idea of authorship and the  bane  of  attachment.  It  may  be\nargued  that  prescribed  Vedic  activities   have   rewards   automatically\nassociated with them such as entry to Svarga  the  heavenly  planets  so  by\nsuch inseparable relationships they  are  clear  incentives.  This  is  also\napplicable to the merits accrued from nitya or daily duties  and  naimittika\nor occasional duties as well. These actions can be compared  to  planting  a\nmango tree and the  fruits  can  be  considered  the  rewards  thereof.  But\nmotivation for the rewards of actions opposed to bhakti or exclusive  loving\ndevotion to Lord Krishna  and  is  inimical  to  moksa  or  liberation  from\nmaterial existence. Verily this is true. So  all  rewards  whether   or  not\ndesirable or undesirable must be renounced  as  only   activities  performed\nwithout motive and hankering for rewards are  to  be  enacted  and  this  is\nactual renunciation.\n\n",

Still  other  prescribed  Vedic   activities\nsuch as a Vishnu yagna which is ritualistic propitiation and worship of  the\nSupreme Lord are performed during extraordinary  celebrations  such  as  the\ninstallation of the vigraha or authorised deity form  of  the  Supreme  Lord\nKrishna or any of His authorised incarnations and expansions as revealed  in\nVedic scriptures.

Even if one is able to  assimilate  bodily  sustenance\nfrom sunshine or by air alone as  some  elevated  yogis  do  that  is  still\nperforming action.\n\nFood not first consecrated unto the Supreme Lord is  considered  sinful  and\nsuch food produces delusion and bewilderment in thinking.

The purifying vestiges of  sanctified\nfood ingested after  the  performance  of  the  holy  yagna  is  capable  of\nimparting sacred knowledge conducive to atma  tattva  or  soul  realisation.\nCognition of the Supreme Lord and  communion  with  Him  is  dependent  upon\ninternal and external purity which are  mandatory  pre-requisites.  Purified\nfood purifies the mind, a purified  mind  has  the  ability  to  access  the\nesoteric spiritual reality that assures moksa or  liberation  from  material\nexistence.  So  the  reality  is  that  prescribed  Vedic   activities   and\nobligatory duties are to be performed all throughout one's life even  up  to\nthe last day of departing the present existence as  they  guarantee  one  is\nable to fulfil the goals of human existence. So abstinence  from  performing\nthem is not in one's best interest. Those  that  desist,  ignore,  disregard\nand blaspheme are influenced by illusion and are locked  in  tama  guna  the\nmode of ignorance. For it has been traced by the enlightened that  the  idea\nof abstinence of prescribed Vedic activities was induced by  tama  guna  and\ngoverned by illusion. Ignorance is that  which  is  hostile  to  wisdom  and\nexists  as  perverted  knowledge.  So  abstaining  from   prescribed   Vedic\nactivities is in the category of  perverted  knowledge.

The phrase mam ekam saranam vraja means to take  exclusive  shelter\nin the Supreme Lord Krishna understanding that He is the most  worthy,  most\ndesirable and most worshipable of all that exists. That this is the  quality\nof renunciation warranted in the  Vedic  scriptures  that  is  required  was\nevidenced by the Supreme Lord in the beginning of this chapter. In  verse  4\nHe stated: Hear the truth about renunciation which is threefold. In verse  9\nHe stated: Actions are  deemed as renunciation in sattva guna  the  mode  of\ngoodness when desire for rewards are abandoned. In verse 11 He  stated:  One\nis known as renounced who renounces the rewards for  actions.  Lord  Krishna\nis promising His devotees that He will personally redeem  and  deliver  from\nall sins His devotee who lives their life  in  the  manner  just  explained.\nThis includes sins of commission and sins of omission that accumulated  over\nuncountable lifetimes from time immemorial. Past sins  are  immense  burdens\nand obstacles in achieving moksa  or  liberation  from  material  existence.\nThen to assure that what He has stated  is  a  surety  He  states  ma  sucah\nmeaning there is no need to despair.\n\nAnother interpretation is that Lord Krishna consoles His  devotees  who  may\nbe stricken with grief by the thought of so many sins committed and  omitted\nin countless past  lives.  For  karma  yoga  and  jnana  yoga  there  is  no\nrestrictions in performing actions  and  acquiring  knowledge  respectively;\nbut for bhakti yoga which is exclusive, personal loving devotion  unto  Lord\nKrishna or any of His authorised  avatars  or  incarnations  and  expansions\nsuch as Rama, Vamana,  Narasingha, etc. to be performed all ones  sins  must\nbe entirely dissolved and one must have great love for the Supreme  Lord  as\nwell. A devotee may have great love for the  Supreme  Lord  but  eradicating\nall one's sins is another matter. There are only two ways to  eradicate  all\nsins.  Either  by  the  acceptance  of  the  Vaisnava  spiritual  master  in\nauthorised disciplic succession who takes  all  one's   sins  and  transfers\nthem upwards to his guru who transfers them  upwards  to  his  guru  and  so\nforth and so on all the way back to Lord Krishna  who  personally  dissolves\nthem all immediately is one way.  The  other  way  is  by  personal  effort.\nReflecting on all the sins one has accumulated since the beginning  of  time\nand then not even the committed sins but only just  the  omitted  sins  like\nnot fasting from grains on Ekadasi when all sins of the world  enter  grains\non the 11th day of the new and full  moons  is  enough  for  a   devotee  to\nbecome quite dismayed. In a human lifetime of Earth it is  not  possible  to\nexhaust by expiatory rituals and  austerities  all  the  sins  hoarded  over\ninnumerable lifetimes. There is not enough time so contemplating their  lack\nof qualification a sincere devotee would despair. To  console  His  devotees\nLord Krishna omnisciently understands that to eradicate all  the  myriad  of\nsins accumulated over unlimited  lives  by  expiatory  ceremonies  would  be\nfutile in the short span of life a human  being  has.  Such  ceremonies  are\ndifficult to conduct successfully, are costly and time consuming and so  any\nchance of successfully eradicating all one's sins in this way is out of  the\nquestion. To alleviate this difficulty Lord  Krishna  reveals  the  solution\nwhich grants success in order to be able to  embark upon bhakti yoga  is  to\nexclusively take complete refuge in Him. There is  no  cost  whatsoever  for\nadmission. The Supreme Lord who is the creator,  maintainer,  protector  and\nsustainer of the total  creation,  most  magnanimously  and  compassionately\ngives exclusive shelter to those who seek Him  exclusively  and  irrevocably\npromises to  eradicate  all  one's  sins  which  are  the  awesome  barriers\nprohibiting one from communion with  the  Supreme  Lord  and  the  ambrosial\nbliss of bhakti.\n\n\n",
  "18-61": "\nManmana bhava is a divine command that means to  always  have  Lord  Krishna\ncompletely and blissfully in one's thoughts, to absorb oneself in Him.  This\nis  also  established  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  where  we  find  in   the\nTaittiriyaranyaka Upanisad  III.XII  beginning  vedaham  etam  stating:  The\nResplendent Supreme Lord more radiant then thousands of suns is realised  by\nabsorbing the mind in Him by  meditation.  Realising  Him  Him  one  attains\nmoksa liberation from material existence. There  exists  no  other  path  to\nimmortality.  This  devotional  absorption  in  Lord  Krishna  is  of   such\nmagnitude and intensity that its meditation becomes a vision and the  vision\nbecomes an ever flowing current of  devotion  that  is  so  vivid  that  the\nexperience actually enters the realm of reality.\n\nMad-bhakta is to offer all one's loving emotions to Lord Krishna  enthralled\nby love overflowing with enthusiasm, exuberance and excitement.\n\nMad-yagi is to worship Lord Krishna with  love.  To  install  Him  in  one's\nheart as their personal worshipable diety. Such worship is  the  performance\nof the entire services that a liege administers to His sovereign on a  daily\nbasis  upon  waking  untill  sleeping.  Yagi  comes  from  yajana  which  is\nsynonymous with pujana or worship and denotes aradhanam  the  most  equisite\nloving worship. Therefore it is  not  a  mere  dry,  formal  observation  of\nceremonial ritual enacted out of duty. It is love flowing  from  the  heart.\nIt is a testament of devotion from the eternal  svarupa  or  one's  immortal\nspiritual form. Mad yagi should be interpreted as  offering  one's  self  to\nLord Krishna as a brother, as a parent or as a beloved with a heart full  of\nlove.\n\nMam namaskuru is to enshrine Lord Krishna in  the  heart  with  the  utmost,\nlove, devotion and faith. Namas comes from namanam meaning  obeisance.  Such\nobeisance is not a mere habitual genuflexion; but a  sublime  expression  of\nsincere gratitude and humility that constitutes  an  emotion  of  love  felt\ninternally.\n\nIf a blessed devotee of Lord  Krishna  arrives  at  this  exalted  vista  of\nbhakti or exclusive loving devotion then the Supreme Lord will not  hesitate\nto have their eternal  individual  association  with  Him  in  the  immortal\nspiritual worlds. This is the truth that  He  Himself  promises.  It  should\nnever be interpreted as being just a metaphor or mere flowery prose. Such  a\nhypothesis would not be genuine and incorrect.\n\nWherever there is a heart that has so much love for Lord Krishna then  there\nis as much love from Lord Krishna back to them. Lord Krishna's love is  such\nthat He finds it impossible to bear the  separation  from  such  surrendered\nand dedicated devotees and therefore  without  delay  He  personally  brings\nthem to Him directly in  their  eternal  spiritual  body  even  while  their\nphysical body is concluding its last life in material existence.\n\nSo it should be clearly and emphatically understood that  the  Supreme  Lord\nKrishna's solemn promise to His surrendered devotees is the total truth  and\nnothing other than truth  for  which  He  pledges  to  vouch  safe  for  His\ndevotees for all eternity.\n\n",
  "18-74": "\nThe name yogesvara attributed to Lord Krishna means  the  ultimate  lord  of\nall  yogas  or  all  prescribed  Vedic  activities  that  lead  directly  to\ncommunion  with  the  Supreme  Lord  who  is  the  sole  bestower   of   all\ndispensations, benedictions and rewards for all  endeavours  appropriate  to\nthe qualification of the aspirant and the quality of the  action  after  the\naccumulative karma or reactions to all actions  in  all  forms  of  previous\nexistences  sentient  or  insentient  have  been  calculated  and  tabulated\nthroughout all creation. One time one existed as a demigod, another time  as\na demon, aother time as an animal, another time as  a  human  all  forms  of\nlife are dependent upon the actions performed in the previous life. All  are\nsubject to diversities of existence. They  have  their  beginning  and  they\nhave an ending. Only the Supreme Lord who  is  eternally  spiritual  in  His\nform, nature and  qualities  being  completely  transcendental  to  material\nexistence along with His  liberated  associates  and  servitors,  who  first\nrealising the atma or immortal soul they achieved moksa  or  liberation  and\nsubsequently attained eternal communion with the Supreme Lord.\n\nWherever  Lord  Krishna  and  Arjuna  are  present  and  whenever  they  are\nglorified by thinking about them, or reading about them, or  speaking  about\nthem, or hearing about them, then  at  that  very  place  will  be  srih  or\nopulence, vijaya  or victory, bhutih or opulence and niti or  righteousness.\n\n\nThus ends the commentaries on Srimad Bhagavad-Gita Chapter 18 entitled\nMoksa Opadesa Yoga:Final Revelations of the Ultimate Truth by\nRamanujacarya.\n\nThis completes the Sri Bhagavad-Gita Trust translations and commentaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
  "18-39": "\nThe word svabhava means one's inherent nature. This inherent nature  arises\nfrom samskaras or past impressions and karma or reactions from past actions\nand is the root cause of determining birth as a Brahmin. The three gunas or\nmodes of material nature arising from prakriti or the  material  substratum\npervading all existence are determined by karma and samskaras as well.  The\npredominating attribute of the Brahmins or spiritual class is  sattva  guna\nthe mode of goodness. The predominating characteristic of the  ksatriya  or\nadministrative class is raja guna the mode of  passion.  The  predominating\ncharacteristic of the vaisyas or mercantile class is tama guna  mixed  with\nraja guna and the predominating characteristic of the sudras is  only  tama\nguna. Duties and responsibilities vary according to position and status  in\nsociety as assigned by the Vedic scriptures. It  is  the  Vedic  scriptures\nwhich defines what qualities are possessed by Brahmins  and  what  are  the\nduties proper to their status as well as what occupations they  may  engage\nin. This Vedic directive applies to the other orders in society as well.\n\n"
